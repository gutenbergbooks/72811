<p>The scene of this little sketch is laid in one of the most delightful
of our sea-coast residences, as it respects local situation; one
of the earliest settlements of New England, and the birthplace of
many individuals, whose memory, though perhaps unknown to
fame, is cherished by their descendants to the third and fourth
generation. With the hope that it may be received with favor,
and do good, the writer, who is herself a native of Lynn, offers it
to the public.</p>

<p>There is no prospect more lovely and attractive to those who
were born upon its shores, than that of the Ocean. In the heat
and sunshine of a bright summer day, there is a delicious coolness
and refreshment in the breezes which float over its waters never
to be forgotten by the wanderer from his native home, and even
the hollow murmuring of its waves, when presaging an approaching
storm, and their wild roar when the tempest is abroad in its
fury, is remembered with a sort of pleasure as being the lullaby
for many a calm and sound night’s sleep. In sickness, when far
away from the land of his birth, the exile will remember its pure
and healthful atmosphere, and in his dreams, perhaps, fancy himself
treading the pebbly shore, and feeling the pleasant air upon
his fevered brow. Such a fond remembrance has led to the location
of the scene of this tale, a remembrance which will exist as
long as memory remains.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“And this is the end of all our plans and anticipations for the
winter? Oh, Mary, what shall we do through this long dreary
season of nearly six months? No balls, no parties, indeed, no society,
shut up in my aunt’s lonely house, with nothing to amuse
us but the sound of the dismal waves, dashing against the rocks,
the mournful wind, whistling through that forest of apple trees,
and not a man to be seen but old Philip”—and here the voice of the
speaker was stopped by her tears which were, however, soon
soothed by the mild and gentle voice of her sister.</p>

<p>“Do look on the bright side of things, dear Susan,” said she,
“you forget, how, when we were little girls, we used to love that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
orchard, how many merry plays we have had among those trees,
and how many stories old Phillip would tell us; then, the beautiful
shells we picked up upon the little beach, at the foot of the
rocks,”—“But that was in the summer, Mary, when you know it
is pleasant out doors, and that was when we were so young, and
so easily amused, but now it is so very different, and then Aunt
Wilson is so very, very pious—Oh; she will not let us read anything
but sermons, or sing anything but psalm tunes.”</p>

<p>This was, indeed, but a gloomy prospect for a gay young girl of
seventeen, and it required more stoicism than Susan Morton possessed
to view it with indifference. The illness of their father,
the necessity of his seeking a warmer climate through the winter,
and his wish that his wife should accompany him, were the reasons
which had induced him to trust his daughters, during his absence,
to the care of his sister, a widow lady of much respectability,
who resided near the sea-coast, and, who, since the death of
her husband, had devoted her time and talents to the education of
her children, two sons and a daughter; and, it was after bidding a
sorrowful adieu to their parents, and finding themselves shut up
in the carriage, which was to convey them to their winter home,
that this conversation commenced. Susan was the youngest of
the two sisters, a lively beautiful girl, very fond of society, and
always the life and animation of every circle. She had formed
many gay schemes of pleasure for the coming winter, the winter
after she entered her seventeenth year, which had been all dispersed
by the gradual but increasing illness of her father, and she
had listened to the arrangement which had consigned her to the
care of her aunt through that season which she had anticipated
with so much delight with a dissatisfaction and gloom, which prevented
her from seeing anything pleasant in their winter abode, or
seizing upon any circumstances to soften her disappointment. Not
so with Mary; with as lively a disposition as her sister, she still
possessed the happy talent of extracting pleasure from any situation,
and enjoying herself under almost any circumstances, and
now endeavored, with earnest kindness, to bring to her remembrance
many little events of their early youth, connected with their
aunt and her family, which would aid in restoring her tranquility,
and she succeeded, for before their arrival at their destined home,
Susan had joined in many a merry laugh at some pleasant recollection.
The evening of a dull November day closed in before
they arrived at the end of their journey, the monotonous dashing
of the waves against the beach sounded drearily, and the chilly
air, and the gloomy appearance of the sky made them welcome the
bright light, which they knew, streamed from the retired dwelling
of their aunt. The carriage now turned into the lane which led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
to the house, and they were greeted at the porch by the kind old
Philip, whose hair seemed not a shade whiter, nor his face a
whit more wrinkled than when, five years before, two lively little
girls, they bade him “good-bye,” at that very door. They had
hardly time to return his good humored smile, when they were
surrounded by the rest of the family, and the affectionate caresses
of their aunt, the joyous welcome of their cousins, and even the
broad smile which displayed the white teeth of black Phoebe,
made them feel that they had, indeed, as Philip said, “Got home
again,” and caused Susan to forget her sad forebodings. The
transition from the cold darkness of the evening without to the
pleasant warmth and cheerful light of the sitting room was delightful,
and, in a short time Susan found herself seated among
a circle of lovely and beloved friends, all striving to make her
happy, and all happy together, and, when, after an evening of the
most charming sociability, she found herself alone with her sister,
she acknowledged that she was never more entertained than she
was this evening.</p>

<p>A bright and pleasant morning sun after a night of uninterrupted
and tranquil repose, rendered sweet by the fatigue of the
preceding day, restored all the gay cheerfulness of Susan, and she
received the kind greetings of her friends, and their affectionate
inquiries, with all her wonted good humor. A livelier party never
surrounded a breakfast table, from the mother to the youngest
of Mrs. Wilson’s children, the light-hearted Charles, a sprightly,
intelligent boy of thirteen. Her eldest, a son, a member of the
University, had returned to his home to spend the winter vacation.
Herbert Wilson was a noble specimen of the youth of New
England, active and enterprising, uniting to a fine constitution,
habits of industry and order, and already ranking high among the
talented sons of his native State. Elizabeth, the daughter, was
the counterpart, in disposition, of her cousin Mary; she was the
friend and companion of her mother, and the loving counsellor of
her brothers. The clouds of the preceding evening had dispersed;
it was one of those delightful days which sometimes occur in November;
a walk was proposed to the seashore, and with light and
happy hearts, the young party, after crossing the brow of the
hill, which separated them from the ocean, beheld its vast expanse
stretched before them in boundless majesty. The sands,
covered with shells, sparkled in the sunbeams; far off, in the distance,
were seen the white sails of ships, some leaving their native
shores, and some returning to them, and, in the southwest, rose
the dome of the State House and many spires of Boston, from
whence, on a clear morning, might be heard the cheerful sound
of bells. On the smooth beach that united the shore with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
beautiful peninsula of Nahant, were seen sportsmen with their
guns, in pursuit of the wild fowl, which were wheeling in hurried
circles above their heads, and, here and there, a fishing boat, lying
upon the surface of the water, while its owner was engaged in his
customary employment of fishing. “How delightful,” said Susan,
“I could not have believed it would have been so pleasant here in
November. I think I shall be quite contented here, after all.”
“But reflect, my cousin,” said Herbert, “this is one of our days of
sunshine, what will you say in the days of storm and tempest,
when the waves dash against these rugged rocks, and the rain
pours in torrents or snow darkens the atmosphere?” “Oh,” said the
listening Charles, “you would not be discontented then, for, you
know, the days are short, and soon pass away, and the evenings
are so pleasant. Oh, cousin Susan! you don’t know anything
about those winter evenings.” “Do tell me about them, Charlie,
do tell me,” said the lively Susan. “Well, then, Herbert reads”—“Stop,
stop, my little man,” said Herbert, “do not let Susan waste
all her pleasure in anticipation, but, I hope, dear cousin of mine,
to convince you that our happiness is not dependent upon the
weather, or upon local situation, and, that, years hence, perhaps,
on some bright day, in the most delightful season of the year, or,
when surrounded, it may be with everything to make your life
happy, you will look back to this winter in retirement as one of
the bright spots in your existence.” “I am half inclined to believe
you, dear Herbert, but we will walk faster, for I think Mary and
Elizabeth have found a prize.” Charles now bounded over the
sands, and, upon joining his sister and cousin, found them engaged
in examining a shell fish of singular construction. “Why,
it is nothing but a horseshoe,” said he. “Uncle Bill says they call
them so because they look like one, and, look, Herbert, there is
Uncle Bill himself, with a basket of clams. Hurrah! Uncle Bill,
what will you do with your clams?” He then ran to join a man
who was coming from the edge of the water, where he had been
employed in procuring the contents of his basket. He was slightly
built, of a florid complexion, and a mild sensible countenance,
but a certain wandering and restless expression indicated an unsettled
mind. As Herbert greeted him kindly his eyes lighted with
animation, and his respectful salute to the young ladies had an
air of good breeding, unusual in a person in his apparent condition
of life. To the repeated question of Charles as to what he
would do with his clams, he said he would carry some to Phoebe,
that she might make him a chowder. “That is the very thing,
Uncle Bill; hurrah for clam chowder, and I’ll go forward and
tell her,” said Charles, and he ran on, followed more slowly by
Uncle Bill. “There is something singular in the appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
that man,” said Mary. “There is something singular in his history,”
said Herbert. “Sometime, on one of those stormy days of
which I have forewarned Susan, I will tell you the outlines of it.”
“Oh, no outlines,” said Susan, “tell me all the particulars, all the
little shades of the story. I do not like rough sketches, I have not
imagination enough to fill them up.” “I will tell you all I myself
know of his life,” said Herbert, “and it is an illustration of the
caprice and coquetry of which some of your sex are accused.”
“A love story; that will be grand,” said Susan, “only it is a pity
that the hero is an old clam merchant.”</p>

<p>A cheerful walk returned them to their home, where each resorted
to their usual avocations, Herbert to pursue his studies and
instruct Charles, Elizabeth to attend to and learn the necessary
duties of a housewife, and during their morning walk she had
contrived to inspire Mary with a desire to emulate her in becoming
a complete cook and housekeeper, and thus give her kind
mother an agreeable surprise on her return. Susan, also, was
forming many plans for her winter pursuits, among which, one
was commencing the study of Latin, under the instruction of Herbert,
and another of working, in worsted, a cover for a family
Bible, with the names of her parents wrought upon it, in imitation
of the one which laid upon her aunt’s table, and which she
thought would please her father and mother. Thus the day
passed, and when the family surrounded the tea table, health and
cheerfulness glowed in every countenance, and Susan forgot
every cause of discontent. After the tea things were removed.
“Now,” said Charles, “now for the story, Herbert.” “What,”
said Susan, “about Uncle Bill?” “No, no, not now,” said Charles,
“a story about Rome, in the time of the early Christians. I am
studying the history of Rome in Latin, and Herbert promised he
would read a story about it.” “In that case, Charles,” said Mrs.
Wilson, “you will be able to detect any deviations from the truth
of history.” “But, may I speak, mother, when I think I find anything
that is not true?” “There will be times, my dear, when
Herbert will pause awhile, and then you can make your remarks.”
“There is a peculiar charm,” said Herbert, “in retracing the records
of antiquity, for we lose sight, in the distance, of all roughness
and inequalities, and our imagination only rests upon the
smooth and distant perspective. I remember journeying with my
father, many years ago, through the northern part of this State,
and when I remarked to him that the hills which we saw around
us looked as if they were highly cultivated, their surface appearing
so even and delightful, here and there dotted with clumps of
trees, he repeated the words of the poet, ‘’Tis distance lends enchantment
to the view.’ ‘If, my son, you were there, upon those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
very spots that appear so pleasant, you would be disappointed by
their rugged and uneven appearance, perhaps deformed with unsightly
stumps, or with patches of rock.’” “So it is with the romance
of history,” said Elizabeth, “but, if we are too critical in
our remarks, we should lose much pleasure.” “True,” said Herbert,
“and therefore, not to spoil the appetite of Charles for our
little tale, we will not proceed with our illustrations.” Herbert
produced his manuscript, the little circle arranged themselves at
their different employments, and silence ensued, while in a clear
voice he commenced reading a tale of which the scene was laid in
the days of Nero, the tyrant of Rome, and the malignant persecutor
of the Christians.</p>

<p>It was on a bright and beautiful evening, just as the delightful
sun of Italy was declining, that Cleone, a young Roman maiden,
walked with her mother along the pleasant banks of the Tiber.
They had chosen a retired walk for many reasons, one of which
was that retirement better suited their dispositions, and another
that Rome was, at that time, filled with a dissolute nobility, whose
wills were almost their only law. Cleone and her mother were descendants
of ancient and noble families, who had counted amongst
their numbers grave and influential senators, warlike and victorious
soldiers, and even mingled their blood with the powerful
kings and dictators of Rome; but time, with its changing scenes,
had reduced them in power and wealth, though oppression and
poverty had not taken from them the proud consciousness of former
greatness. “My daughter,” said the matron, “look at that
glorious sun, though declining, though its splendor will shortly
be obscured, yet it will rise again, with renewed and more brilliant
light, and shed joy and happiness with its glad beams. So, dearest,
shall the sun of our fortunes, though now almost disappearing,
again rise, and the virtues of our own Curtius pour light and
warmth on all within their influence. Believe this, my own
Cleone, and let the thought disperse those clouds of melancholy,
believe that your mother is a prophetess, and this time of good.”
“Mother,” said Cleone, “I will try to have faith in your augury,
but my brother is in a prison, in the power of a tyrant; how can
we hope?” “He is under the protecting power of that Being in
whom we trust, who has comforted us in affliction, and preserved
us in danger, and who will not now forsake us. He, whose
power can melt the flinty rock, can soften even the hard heart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
a Nero. Do you remember, Cleone, the deathbed of your father,
when, laying his hand on the youthful head of our Curtius, after
commending us to his love and protection, he blessed him in the
name of the only living and true God. ‘Even,’ said he, ‘though
called to the death of a martyr, let him never forsake the God of
his father.’ The prayer of the dying saint has been heard; midst
temptations, in the view of danger and death the undaunted youth
has never been shaken in his fidelity to his God, and by his noble
courage has forced even the haughty tyrant and his minions to
respect.” “Oh, that I could restore him to you, dear mother.
Last night I woke from disturbed slumber; the bright beams of
the moon rested upon my couch, all was calm and still, the very
air breathed peace, but the thought of my darling brother, shut
out from all this loveliness, and exposed to the unwholesome
damps of a dungeon, weighed heavy upon my mind. I threw
myself upon my knees, I prayed God that he would save him
from the cruel Emperor. Oh, mother, I did not again lie down
until peace and comfort entered my mind, and I felt that if he
lived or died, I could say, ‘Thy Holy will be done,’ but mother, I
cannot always say so.” Thus communing they had arrived at a
lovely spot, surrounded by trees whose luxuriant foliage almost
touched the ground. Here they seated themselves upon the bank;
the beautiful appearance of the river, as the bright sky was reflected
upon the waters, the songs of the birds over their heads,
the buzzing of innumerable insects, and the hum of the city, softened
by distance, tranquillized their minds. “My Cleone, join
your voice to this chorus, and sing our evening hymn.” Obedient
to her mother’s wish, she sang, with sweet melody, the simple
strain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The shades of night are closing o’er us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">God of Heaven, watch our sleep!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the sake of the Lord Jesus</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Wilt thou still thy servants keep?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lord! though dangers may surround us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">We are safe beneath thy care.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy blest angels may attend us;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Holy Father, bow thine ear!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the low, sweet voice of Cleone died upon the air, a slight
rustling of the bushes startled them and, turning quickly, they
beheld a woman whose fixed and earnest gaze was riveted upon
them. Leaning upon a staff, enveloped in a dark gray mantle,
the hood of which covered her head, she appeared lost in thought.
Her grey locks and the deep furrows of her face betokened extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
age, while her eyes, black, deep-set and piercing, showed
that her mind still retained its powers. Her attention seemed
fixed upon Cleone, whose countenance expressed terror at her
unexpected appearance. “Lady,” said she, and her deep and
hollow voice sounded as from the tomb, “do not fear; your voice
has awakened feelings which I thought long since dead. Years
of sin and misery seemed like a dream as I listened, and a youth
of innocence and love was present to my thought. Thanks,
maiden, for the momentary trance. Scion of the noble house of
Curiatii, a dark cloud hangs heavy over your fortunes; He in
whom you trust can disperse it. The gray moss waves on the
lofty towers of the Atili, but their stones are yet firm and unbroken;
the stately pine is decaying, but the young sapling is yet
vigorous, and its shoots will press upward, the lamp of life glimmers
but faintly in the breast of the aged, and will soon be extinguished,
yet a bright spark remains in the young and noble to
rekindle the ancient blaze. Lady, hearken to the prophecy of one
who, though sinful and despairing, forgets not the remnant of the
illustrious house that reared her childhood.” “You are unhappy,
mother,” said the matron in the soothing tone of kindness, “but
you must not say despairing. He who has offered up his life
for us, who has borne our sins upon the cross, has left us the
blessed assurance that all who repent need not despair.” “Aye,”
said the Sybil, while a strong shudder shook her frame, “you
are a Christian; enough,” and her eyes gleamed with almost terrific
wildness; “away,” and, waving her hand, she disappeared
among the trees. A moment of deep silence succeeded her departure,
which was broken by Cleone. “Is not this frightful,
mother? Who can this woman be? and does she mean us good
or evil?” “Her words would seem to imply good to us, my
daughter, but dark and, I fear, unrepented wickedness burthens
her mind, benighted indeed, if without the cheering ray of hope.
Who she is I know not; tradition tells of those who have leagued
themselves with the powers of darkness, but there was kindness
in her words; let us think of her no more, my dearest, but quickly
retrace our steps. We have already left our kind uncle too long.”
“Ah, we will not linger, dear mother, he is so feeble.” The twilight
deepened around them as they bent their way to their home,
but the moon was rising in unclouded splendor and its mild beams
diffused a brilliancy around the landscape more beautiful than
that of day. “How many, my Cleone, have listened to the murmur
of these waves and watched the reflection of these moonbeams;
how many noble and gifted beings whom we have been
taught to love and admire, have, perhaps upon this very spot,
gazed upon this same lovely scene. This same quiet and sparkling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
sky has shone upon the form of many a noble Roman whose
heart was devoted to his country. Time moves on in his never-resting
course and, centuries hence, my daughter, this river will
roll on, as it now does, this sky sparkle with the same brilliancy,
and beings, within whose forms the current of life flows as
warmly as it now does in ours, will watch the unceasing motion
of this stream and admire this pure and lovely firmament as
we do.”</p>

<p>The family of the Curiatii, once powerful in Rome, was now
represented by the young Quintius Curtius and his sister; civil
wars and oppressions had reduced their numbers and torn from
them their possessions and these, the last of an illustrious race,
were even dependent upon the charity of an almost superannuated
old man, the uncle of his mother. Their father, while serving
in the Roman bands in Judea, had become a convert to
Christianity and, while his children were yet young, had died in
the full faith of the Christian’s hope, bequeathing them, as he believed,
a rich legacy, in commending them to that Being who has
said: “Leave thy fatherless children to me,” and, with a firm
confidence that their mother would educate them in the “nurture
and admonition of the Lord.” Most faithfully had that tender
mother redeemed her pledge to her dying husband, and, with a
noble fortitude, she had endured every privation and cheerfully
made every sacrifice for the eternal welfare of those beloved
children, and with that joy which only the Christian parent can
feel, she had seen them, while growing in their loveliness, devoting
themselves to the service of the God of their father. Who
has not shuddered at the atrocious cruelties of the reign of Nero?
The wicked tyrant, whose greatest happiness seemed to consist
in causing the misery of his fellow-beings, and where is the heart
that has not beat in sympathy with the sufferings of those
Christian martyrs, who, with a firm and unshaken constancy, endured
the torments inflicted by that monster in human form,
even until death, rather than deny the “Lord who bought them.”
Educated in retirement, the young Curtius had for some time
escaped notice, but as he grew in years and, through the influence
of friends, had been introduced into public life, he was no
longer shielded by obscurity. In his noble countenance was portrayed
his high and commanding talents and vice and wickedness
shrank abashed from the quick glance of his eye. Is it, then, to
be wondered that he became an object of dislike to the infamous
emperor and that the cruel tyrant sought an excuse to gratify his
feelings of hatred, for, without an excuse, even Nero dared not
attack the virtuous young Roman who was equally the object of
love and admiration. That excuse was not long wanting, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the undaunted youth feared not to confess Christ before men,
and that alone was crime of the deepest dye in the Pagan court of
Nero. Summoned before the emperor, his firm yet respectful
deportment and calm and decided answers commanded the admiration
of all, even of the tyrant himself, who, with the strange
inconsistency of his character, could even admire and applaud
where he hated and had determined to destroy. But it would be
greater matter of triumphs to Nero to induce the high-souled
Curtius to renounce his religion than to take his life and, therefore,
summoning to his aid those bland and persuasive manners
he could so well assume, he, during many interviews, attempted
to sap the foundation of that virtue, which was based upon a
principle, enduring as eternity, till, finding every effort ineffectual,
his rage knew no bounds, and the young Christian was closely
confined, debarred from the sight of his mother and sister, and
only respited until the imperial ruffian had contrived new modes
of torture to enhance the bitterness of death. But, although cast
into the dreariest dungeon, and apparently deprived of every comfort,
this son of a sainted father was not only resigned to his fate,
but even triumphant in the thoughts of martyrdom, and, though
deprived of the sight of those friends so dear to his heart, felt a
sweet serenity in the conviction that he was the object of their fervent
prayers and fondest solicitude. Who can estimate the unspeakable
consolation he derived from the invisible presence of
that Saviour who has promised, “I will never leave you comfortless,”
who has said, “Let not your heart be troubled, neither let
it be afraid.”</p>

<p>“You will read more, you will not leave off yet, Herbert,” said
Charles. “Our time is expended,” said Herbert, “and, in order to
enjoy pleasure, we must not prolong it until it becomes wearisome.”
“Wearisome!” said Susan, “we should not even think of
the idea.” “I could almost wish,” said Elizabeth, “to have been
one of the first Christians, even amidst all their dangers. Such
firm confidence, such joyful hope, and holy love would seem
cheaply gained by all their sufferings.” “I almost believe,” said
Mary, “that placed in their situation, I, too, could have risen
above fear; that I could almost rejoice to die in such a cause.”
“Their situation was indeed peculiar,” said Mrs. Wilson. “The
power of God was with them and supported them. He was their
refuge and strength, their present help, therefore they did not
fear. Left to our own weakness we are as nothing, supported by
his mighty arm, we are powerful, invincible.” “My curiosity,”
said Susan, “is much excited by the old woman, and I shall like to
find out who she is.” “You called her a Sybil, Herbert,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Charles. “There is a story in my History of Rome of a woman
who went to one of the kings to sell some mysterious books,
which he refused to purchase. She went away and burned some,
then came back and asked the same price for those remaining,
and continued to do so till she had burned a good many, and, at
last, the king bought those that were left, and they were considered
of so much value that officers were appointed to take
care of them and they were consulted upon all important matters.”
“You are right, Charles,” said Herbert, “there is such a
relation, and perhaps we may class this amongst the romance of
history. Time and the mists of tradition have rendered it impossible
to learn how much truth is connected with these fables,
but we know that in the ancient days of Rome, much reliance was
placed upon those who pretended to a knowledge of future events,
and, perhaps, the general belief in such knowledge induced many
of wild imaginations to believe themselves endowed with this
prophetic spirit. You may suppose, Susan, if you wish, to break
the illusions of fancy that this ancient female was one of those
fanatical beings, who had cheated herself into the belief that she
was set apart as one of those mystical oracles.” “Oh, no,” said
Susan, “do not break any illusions; I am very willing to believe
that she was the identical Sybil, who offered those books to the
refractory king.” “Your imagination, dear cousin,” said he, “has
indeed taken a wide circuit, and we will let the curtain of mystery
be spread, for the present, over the story.”</p>

<p>The duties of the succeeding day were not neglected, though
even the short day seemed longer in anticipation of the evening
employments. Cowper has given a delightful description of the
“ushering in” of a winter evening with all its pleasant accompaniments,
and the truth of his lively picture was fully realized as the
happy group collected around the sparkling fire. As Herbert
continued the tale which had so interested them all listened with
attention.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The tender mother and much loved sister had arrived at the
home now rendered solitary by the absence of the son and
brother, whose love had sweetened every passing hour. As they
approached the mansion of their aged relative, upon whose ancient
towers the moon now cast a silvery brightness, and had
ascended the eminence upon which it was situated, they stood for
a moment to contemplate the scene before them. There lay the
proud and magnificent city, its domes and palaces reflecting the
soft brightness, and, here, the waves of the Tiber rolled at their
feet, its winding course lost in the distance. On their right
hand and strongly defined by the light, towered the imperial
palace where abode the haughty arbiter of the fate of their Curtius,
and, on their left stretched that Amphitheatre, the scene of
the most horrid cruelties, drenched with the blood of martyred
victims and strewn with their ashes. One thought seemed to
possess their minds, one terrible reflection to agitate their bosoms,
as they turned, shuddering, from this last prospect and bent their
steps toward their dwelling.</p>

<p>“In a spacious but low apartment, bearing marks of ancient
magnificence, but lighted by only a solitary lamp, lay reclined
upon a couch the kind but feeble old man, so long their protector
and sole friend, but now sinking by age and sorrow, for he had
seen many endeared to him by the most sacred associations suffering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
cruel tortures and an ignominious death for Christ’s sake,
and amongst them the holy apostle Paul, from whose lips he had
first heard the truth proclaimed, “as it is in Jesus.” This stroke
had bowed him to the earth, and, although bending in submission
to the will of his Maker, his frame had yielded and he was
fast hastening to his rest. The untiring watchfulness of faithful
love hovered around him, smoothed his pillow and delighted in
presenting to his rapt attention the joys of heaven. The walls
of that apartment, which had formerly echoed with mirth and
revelry, with the heavy tramp of the warrior preparing for battle
against the enemies of Rome, or with the commanding voice
of the Dictator, issuing mandates to his subjects, now gave back
but the heavy breathing of one of the last of their descendants, a
feeble old man, but in whose exhausted body dwelt a spark of
ethereal fire unknown to them with all their boasted power and
splendor. This feeble old man was a Christian. Near him sat
a faithful domestic, watching over him in the absence of her
mistress with earnest solicitude. As the matron entered the room
and bent over him with anxious love, he raised his eyes and a
smile of affection passed over his features. ‘Welcome, dearest
daughter,’ said he. ‘I am weary of your absence; time passes
heavily when I do not see those forms so dear to my heart.
Where is Cleone?’ ‘Here, dearest father. You are not worse, I
trust. Here is your own Cleone.’ ‘Ah, sweet child, those tones
would almost recall me to life, were it indeed deserting this time-worn
body; but why do I not see my Curtius? Why is he so
long absent? Speak, Octavia; say, Cleone, where is Curtius?’
A look of deep distress shaded their countenances, for with sedulous
care they had concealed from him the situation of that darling
boy who had been, from his earliest youth, the delight of his
heart. ‘Think not, dear father, that, though absent, he forgets
you. Oh, no; his messages are full of love and fond remembrance
and we will pray that the Lord will restore him to us in
his own good time.’ ‘May the blessing of his father’s God rest upon
him and you, dear children. Ah,’ said he, partly addressing those
around him and partly uttering his own thoughts, ‘I could almost
wish that I might live, if it were the will of God, to witness his
bright career of glory, dispensing happiness and prosperity over
our country and turning the hearts of the people from the worship
of their heathen deities to that of the true God. Say, dear
daughter, may we not believe that those ties which unite us on
earth will continue in heaven, nay, even grow stronger through
eternity?’ ‘Father, I cannot doubt it; it is the consoling hope of
the Christian.’ ‘Aye, I shall there meet your father, my Cleone;
perhaps we shall be permitted to watch over those so beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
upon earth.’ ‘Oh, father!’ said Cleone, ‘would that we might
all go together.’ ‘Not so, dearest, you have yet much, I trust,
to do in this world.’ He lay silent for some time, apparently in
deep meditation; then, raising himself upon his couch and clasping
his trembling hands, he said: ‘How long, O Lord, holy and
just, shall this fair land be polluted by these abominations? The
blood of thy servants has been poured out like water; grant, O
Father, that it may call to Thee from the ground, not for
vengeance, but for mercy upon the murderers! And the time
will come,’ said he, his whole countenance glowing with the animation
of youth, ‘the time is not far distant when Rome in her
splendor shall bow before the cross of Jesus; when her haughty
Emperors shall prostrate themselves before the Christian’s God,
and her temples, now blazing with golden honors to Pagan divinities,
shall echo with prayers and thanksgivings to the God of
the whole earth.’ And he fell back upon his pillow, overpowered
by the exulting emotions of his mind, a glow of triumphant joy
still rested upon his features and even retained its station there
after the heart, which had exulted in this vision of futurity, had
ceased to beat and the tongue which had uttered the inspiring
prophecy had become mute in death; for, even as the fervent
‘Amen’ lingered upon the lips of those around him, the spirit left
its decayed tenement and returned to God who gave it.”</p>

<p>Herbert ceased reading and a solemn stillness prevailed for a
few moments, when he repeated the following lines.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“There is more time, yet, dear brother,” said Charles, and Herbert
continued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In a splendid apartment, adorned with all the luxury of luxurious
Rome, and showing, by its magnificence, that it was the abode<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
of a patrician of the first order, was seated at a table a Roman
citizen, evidently of high rank. Rich wines were before him, and
many and deep were his libations while engaged in earnest conversation
with a young noble, who was walking the apartment
with an anxious hurried step. “Nay, my Flavius,” said the one
who was seated, “you are too zealous in this matter. I marvel
much at the change in your appearance; but a short time ago you
were the life of our society; but now, by Bacchus, how you are
altered; even this sparkling Falernian tempts you not, and your
wit and brilliancy, which was the zest of our pleasure, is all vanished.
Come, my friend, throw aside this gloom, I pray you, and,
as for the young Curtius, we will see what can be done, we will
see. He deserves punishment for adhering to his gloomy doctrine,
though, for your sake, we will see what can be effected.
Still, it is a labor of Hercules to attempt to change the purposes
of our mighty Emperor when he has the pleasure of torturing one
of these obstinate Christians in view.” “Do not talk of delay, noble
Galba,” said the young man, “after witnessing the last scene between
the Emperor and Curtius, are you not convinced no time is
to be lost? Preparations are even now making for some exhibition
on the morrow, and, I fear me, this heroic youth is to be
the principal actor in a most cruel tragedy. Servius, you have
much influence over this cruel Nero, will you not exert it to save
this last descendant of an illustrious house? Will not our cheeks
crimson with shame when we look upon those palaces, reared by
his ancestors, when we pass the memorable spot, where the first
Curtius devoted himself to his country? If we suffer this scion
from such a glorious stock to perish thus? And, for what?
Powers of heaven! Why has he not the same right to worship his
God, as we have to bend before the shrine of Jupiter or Bacchus?
He is a Roman citizen, and shielded by that name should be
guarded by the laws of Rome, for he has committed no crime.”
“No crime! Flavius, by the immortal Gods, you are beside yourself.
It is well there is no one present to bear this report to Nero.
Your life, my friend, were not worth a straw. No crime, did you
say, to condemn our Deities? Speak lower, I pray you, our walls
are not thick enough to conceal such a monstrous sentiment.”
“Nay, Galba, this is trifling,” and a shade of deep vexation passed
over the fine features of Flavius. “Will you use your power
over the Emperor to save my friend, or have I overrated your
friendship for me?” “You have overrated my influence with
Nero. ’Tis true, he fears, but he also hates me, and, for the same
cause, because he believes me a favorite with the soldiery, but, in
this case, he will heed me little, I fear, for he knows he has the
popular voice on his side, when he punishes these Christians, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
because he hates them with a hatred as deadly as can be cherished
in the human breast.” “And what have they done to incur his
hatred? Can it be on account of the conflagration in the city?”
“No. For it is more than suspected that our imperial master
himself caused those fires to be kindled. No, Flavius, the destruction
of the whole city would not have planted in his selfish
breast such a deep and malignant spite. I will tell you the whole
story, for it was while you were in Britain the circumstance occurred,
though I think you must have heard of the beautiful
Valeria.” “I have. She was the favorite of the Emperor.”
“Favorite is too cold a world, my Flavius. All the love and
kindly feelings that ever found a place in the breast of the tyrant
were lavished upon her. Her word was his law. Her slightest
wish was gratified, and most nobly did she use her power. Was
a petition for mercy offered to the Emperor, Valeria was the
first to second it; was an heroic achievement to be rewarded,
Valeria’s hand hastened to bestow the prize; her gentle influence
hushed to repose the stormy and malignant passions rising in the
breast of Nero, and Rome vainly exalted in the belief that their
young ruler’s heart was filled with heaven’s own attribute, mercy,
for it was reported at one time, when a warrant for the execution
of a criminal was presented to him, for his signature, he shed
tears, and wished he had never learned to write. Aye, this very
tyrant, whom we now see surrounded by fawning parasites, and
furiously sacrificing all who dare oppose or obstruct his vile inclinations,
was then, or pretended to be, such an enemy to flattery,
that he severely reprimanded the Senate for amending the wisdom
of his measures saying, ‘Keep your approbation till I deserve
it.’” “But, Valeria,” said the young noble, “how did she lose her
hold upon his affections?” “Some of her relatives or friends,
I believe, had become Christians, and persuaded her to hear the
preaching of one of that sect, an extraordinary man, who pretended
to be inspired by a Superior Being, and who was known by
the appellation of the holy Paul. She was taught by him to believe
that she was committing great wickedness by living with the
Emperor, and secretly quitted the palace, leaving behind her all
the costly gifts of the tyrant, and devoting herself to a life of
prayer. From that moment the rage of the Emperor against this
fanatical sect has known no bounds, and to avow one’s self a
Christian is enough to draw down his fiercest indignation.” “And
what has become of this female? How is it that she has not fallen
a victim to this indignation?” “Her retreat has not been discovered,
although every means has been employed, and, it is said,
that Nero has frequently offered pardon and wealth to the victims
of his hatred, if they would confess where she might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
found, but in vain, for a spirit of determined obstinacy seems to
be the pervading sentiment of these Galileans. Now, with this
feeling of stern revenge which still rankles in his breast, what
chance, think you, is there, that he will extend mercy to this
young man?” “But,” said he, seeing the distress which overspread
the countenance of Flavius, “my endeavors shall not be
wanting. I will own to you, Flavius,” he continued, lowering his
voice almost to a whisper, “I hate this inhuman tyrant, the blood
of my ancestors boils within me when I reflect upon the degeneracy
of Rome, and I have imagined that the statues of our forefathers
frown upon us, as the empty pageants which please his
low and vulgar mind pass our polluted streets. Are we indeed so
base as to submit to the degradation of bending our knee, in servile
adulation, before this mockery of royalty? Did he possess
one redeeming quality, one noble virtue, we might, under that,
shelter our pusillanimity, but, by the shade of Brutus, we have
nought to excuse us in our mean endurance of his vile caprices.
But a few weeks have passed since our venerable Senators, even
in that chamber, rendered sacred by the associations, hallowed in
the heart of every true Roman, were obliged to sanction the admittance
of his favorite horse to the Consulship. By the memory
of those most revered,” said the excited Roman, starting from his
seat, “this shall not be borne!”</p>

<p>The countenance of the young Flavius had reflected the indignant
emotions of the elder speaker, and the deep flush upon
his cheek expressed his sense of the degradation of his country.
“Servius Galba,” he said, in the same subdued, but earnest tone,
“point but the way to relieve Rome of this disgrace, and I will
be the first to follow it.” “Enough,” said Galba, “the path shall
be opened; yes, by the guardian deities of our city, the despicable
tyrant shall yet lick the dust he has polluted, but, my purpose is in
embryo, and I had not thought to say so much, but with you, noble
Flavius, the secret is safe, you shall know more in due time; perhaps
the moment of our deliverance may be nearer than I
thought.” “In the meantime,” said the young noble, “I may rely
upon your intercession for my friend?” “You may,” said he, “I
will see Nero without delay,” and Flavius left the apartment with
an awakened hope for the deliverance of his friend, for he believed
Nero would not dare resist the request of Servius Sulpicius
Galba, the favorite of the powerful soldiery of Rome, and
one of her most popular citizens. Quitting the splendid palace
of the patrician, he passed hastily through the streets, until he
arrived at the large and gloomy building whose walls enclosed
the devoted young Christian, who had become endeared to him
by his virtues, and by that strong tie which binds congenial hearts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Armed soldiers were stationed around, but no opposition was offered
to the entrance of Lucius Flavius. Descending the stone
staircase, and proceeding rapidly through the narrow passages,
he arrived before the cell where he encountered a sentinel, who,
with respect, opposed his farther progress. An order, he said,
had been received from the Emperor, prohibiting all further intercourse
with the prisoner. “That order, my friend, cannot refer
to me. Come, my good fellow, allow me to enter for a few moments,
and here is where withal to pass many a merry hour.”
Half believing that the young Roman was exempted from the
prohibition, and strongly tempted by the glittering bribe, the soldier,
after some hesitation, withdrew the bolts, and permitted him
to enter.</p>
</div>

<p>“Now, my little brother,” said Herbert, “I must call upon you
for a display of self-denial, which you will, perhaps, think too
great. Our mother’s business requires my absence for a few
days; it is a pleasure to me to read the story with you, and if you
will conclude to delay the interest you take in its progress until
my return, we can then share it together; shall it be so?” It
would be difficult to determine whose countenance was most overclouded,
Susan’s or Charles’s. “Oh, certainly we will wait,” said
Charles, “but I am so sorry, and, how long shall you be away,
Herbert?” “Tomorrow is Saturday,” said Herbert. “I will endeavor
to be at home on Wednesday, and you know, Charles, the
Sabbath evening intervenes, when I should not read.” “Do not
despair, dear Charles,” said his mother. “I think we may pass
away the time profitably and pleasantly.” But notwithstanding
this prediction, the cloud had not dispersed when they retired for
the night.</p>

<p>The morning dawned, but not with its usual splendor. Dark
and heavy clouds lowered around the horizon, and many were the
signs foretelling a stormy day, but, as Herbert’s first stage was
only about eight miles, the gloomy weather did not prevent his
journey. Towards afternoon, the storm set in with violence, and
every gloomy prognostic, so well known to those who live near
the ocean, was verified. As evening drew on, Susan stood at a
window, watching the wild motion of the waves, and listening to
their uproar. “Are there not frequent shipwrecks upon this coast,
dear aunt?” said she. “There has been but one within my recollection,”
said Mrs. Wilson; “a vessel, manned principally, I believe,
with seaman from Scotland, was driven from its course
by a terrible storm, and dashed upon the rocks. The bodies of
seven men were found upon the beach in the morning, and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
one living being to lament the loss of his companions. Afterwards,
five or six more were washed on shore, and they were all
interred with respect and due solemnity in the public burying
ground, the solitary survivor attending as chief mourner.”</p>

<p>The thick curtains were drawn around the windows, excluding
the sight, if not the sound, of the tempest without, and the cheerful
group again encircled their warm and glowing fire, but much
lamenting the absence of Herbert. Charles, with much animation,
informed his mother that everything was well sheltered from
the storm. “Philip has shut up old Brindle, snug and warm,”
said he, “and I have helped him fill Robin’s crib.” “That is well,
my good boy,” said his mother, “and now, after taking good care
of your dependents, you can enjoy the comforts of a pleasant

<p>“I like the ballad style of poetry,” said Mary; “it is so natural
and so many little incidents may be introduced which touch the
feelings and delight the fancy.” “I am an admirer of poetry,” said
Mrs. Wilson, “but I have not patience to read much of the sickly
sentiment, dignified by that name, which is beginning to be the
style of the present day, and I much prefer the old English ballad,
with all its homely simplicity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>After a pleasant and lively conversation the evening was closed
and they retired.</p>

<p>The storm had gradually subsided during the night and the
morning sun shone clear. The turbulent waves had receded from
the shining sands, a fresh and mild breeze dispersed every vapor
and the Sabbath morning, in all its calm and peaceful stillness,
was again welcomed. There is no feeling more delightful to one
whose taste is in unison with it than the lovely quiet of a peaceful
Sabbath morning. Even nature seems hushed, the wind lulled
into more tranquil murmurs, and the notes of the birds on a
summer day sound sweeter and more subdued. After the breakfast
table was arranged in due order Philip and Phoebe presented
themselves in their Sunday attire and smiling faces, prepared
to join the family in listening to the reading of the Bible,
and the day was spent in the usual Sabbath duties. “Mother,”
said Charles, “I liked the sermon this afternoon very much because
it was about Ruth.” “It is a story of much interest,” said
Mrs. Wilson, “and read in connection with other parts of the
Bible, of much profit.” “Was the country of the Moabites very
rich and fertile at that time?” “There is no doubt of it, my son,
but it is now accursed of God and almost deserted by man. Formerly
it was a land abounding in wealth and all the luxuries of
life, and through its thickly populated country ran a high road
where were continually passing immense caravans loaded with
rich merchandise, and travellers from different nations, thus distributing
wealth throughout the whole territory. But the sound
of trade and commerce has long since died upon its borders, the
once fruitful soil no longer yields its treasures, and the wandering
Bedouin gains but a miserable subsistence amidst its sandy
deserts, which now echo only the heavy trot of his camels. We
can hardly recognize in the description of late travelers the land
of plenty which gave refuge to the famished Bethlehemites. I
will read you a few lines of a poem entitled “Ruth.”</p>

<p>“It has been a very pleasant Sabbath, dear Aunt,” said Mary,
“so peaceful and quiet.” “I like to remember the Sabbaths of my
youthful days,” said Mrs. Wilson. “Let me repeat some lines
referring to them and you will remember, dear, that in those days
lived many of our old Puritan ministers, so many of whom have
now gone to their rest.”</p>

<p>The love of nature, with its sublime and beautiful prospects,
should be sedulously cultivated in the youthful mind from the
first dawn of reason. The love of reading will be the necessary
consequence, and this, well directed, is one of the greatest blessings
of life. For one whose cultivated imagination is delighted with
descriptions of natural scenery and who is interested in the history
of past ages will not often seek the haunts of dissipation for
amusement. From studying and loving the rich and varied landscape
of nature he is led to the contemplation of “Nature’s God,”
and in the formation of the humblest insect and the rich coloring
of the lowliest flower, as well as in the mightiest work of creation,
will acknowledge the great Creator. Happy they whose
ductile minds are thus early directed and whose maturer judgment
confirms them in the sure road to peace.</p>

<p>The return of Herbert was hailed with joy by the assembled
household and the succeeding evening he fulfilled his promise
of continuing the Tale of the Early Christians.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Seated at a table in a gloomy apartment, lighted by a solitary
lamp, whose ray disclosed the damp and rugged walls, with the
certain prospect of a cruel death before him, and denied even
the solace of a last farewell to his dearest friends, would it have
been wonderful if the countenance of the lonely prisoner, which
was raised at the entrance of Flavius, should have expressed a
deep and settled gloom, or even the stern despair of one who had
bidden adieu to hope. There are those who possess a controlling
power over their emotions, who, even in moments of strong agitation
or excitement, from motives of pride, or the desire of applause,
or some other powerful incentive, will prevent those emotions
from being discovered by assuming a calm and stoical exterior,
but, it was not the haughty pride of the stoic, or the cool
apathy of the philosopher, who has schooled his feelings into
indifference, which met the eye of Flavius, as he encountered the
serene glance of his friend. The noble brow of Curtius was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
placid as a sleeping infant’s, his brilliant eye reflected the heavenly
peace which reigned within, and the smile of welcome with which
he greeted the entrance of his friend was such as we might fancy
adorned the lips of an inhabitant of the regions of undisturbed
happiness. “This is indeed kind, my friend, my brother,” said he,
and as he rose and extended his hand. Flavius perceived that
his limbs were shackled. “Barbarous tyrant,” said the indignant
youth, “is not his malice yet complete? Must these chains be added
to the measure of his cruelty?” “Waste not a thought, my
Flavius, they are proofs of Nero’s consideration for his poor
prisoner, credentials by which he may claim a heavenly residence,
as being made to follow in the footsteps of his Master. Tomorrow,
I am told, is the day of my triumph.” “Curtius,” said his
agitated friend, “all hope is not lost, Galba has promised his
powerful intercession; it cannot fail.” “It will fail, Flavius; as
well might you lure the tiger from his prey as induce the Emperor
to release a Christian from torture and from death.” “And
you contemplate this prospect with calmness; nay, you are even
joyful in it?” “Mistake me not, my friend, life has its charms,
the prospect of death, its mighty terrors; think you I can contemplate
with indifference the dreary grave shutting out the
bright loveliness of nature, separating me from those who are
dearer to me than existence, and closing my ear to the sweet
accents of affection? Not so; but the chilling shudder of these
reflections is checked by the image of Him who suffered the
pangs of death that we might live forever. Far through the
gloomy perspective of the grave, I see the cheering, the delightful,
prospect of immortal life, of a reunion with those beloved ones,
an eternal reunion, and a rapturous vision of joys which eye hath
not seen, and before which the momentary pangs of death dwindle
into nothing. Believe me, my Flavius, were it possible for
Nero to know the all-absorbing joy which fills my heart at these
anticipations, he would revoke his decree, as the severest way of
punishment. But,” said he, and the animated flush faded from
his countenance and the hand which clasped that of Flavius,
pressed it in agitation, “death has indeed its bitterness when I
think of the defenceless ones I shall leave behind.” “Curtius,”
said his friend, “nothing that human means can effect to save you
shall be neglected. But, if all shall fail, give me, my friend, my
brother, give me your sanction to become the son of your
mother; the husband of your sister, and, whilst I have life, their
happiness shall be my dearest object.” Curtius was silent for a
moment, at length, “Flavius,” said he, “the husband of Cleone
must be a Christian.” “And if a full conviction and belief that
the God whom you worship is the only true God, if a deep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
mortifying sense of the degraded nature of our faith, and a longing
desire to possess that trust and heavenly peace which you
possess, is to be a Christian, then am I one, but it is a hard thing
to give up the religion of our fathers, and I feel that I have
not courage to avow these sentiments, and to stem the torrent of
execration which will be poured upon me.” “But the time will
come, my Flavius, when you will avow the God of the Christians
to be your God. Victory, victory,” said the youth, “the temples
of these Pagan deities will yet be consecrated to the service of the
living God, and the incense which rests in clouds, upon their
shrines, will rise in pure and grateful offering to the Holy One of
Israel; yes, my friend, I bequeath to you the dearest treasures I
possess; be to them a faithful guardian, and the blessing of the
Lord rest upon you.” The eloquent countenance of the young
noble expressed the thanks he began to pour forth, when the door
was thrown open, and the sentinel proclaimed that he must leave
the dungeon, as an express to that effect had been received from
the captain of the guard. No delay could be granted, and after a
fervent embrace the friends parted, as Curtius firmly believed, for
the last time. Left alone and relieved from many anxious
thoughts, his mind now turned to the awful scenes of the morrow.
No torments, he well knew, would be too agonizing or too horrid
for the implacable Nero to invent, none too dreadful for his minions
to execute, but his firm and disciplined mind had been too
long accustomed to view death as the portal to never ending happiness,
to shrink now from its near approach, even arrayed in its
utmost terrors. Bending over the table, his thoughts became absorbed
in the bright prospect of future glory, fervent aspirations
of gratitude to God for raising an earthly protector for his mother
and sister, mingling with his reflections, and the Emperor, amidst
his splendor, might have envied his proscribed prisoner his calm
and peaceful anticipations.</p>

<p>Our tale must now return to the deathbed of the aged Christian.
Sudden indeed, as well as most painful, was this event to
his affectionate friends; they had left him but an hour before,
by his own request, as he expressed a fear that their unremitting
attention to him would injure them, little thinking his dissolution
was so near, and, as the conviction pressed upon them that the one
who had supplied the place of the kindest parent, who had shared
his own, even too small pittance with them, was no more, that
they could no longer hear his endearing expressions, no longer see
his mild eye beaming upon them, with parental love, can it be
wondered that every other consideration was lost, for the time,
in the sad reflection. As they bent over the couch in unutterable
grief, their own sorrow was increased by that of the aged domestics,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
who had grown old in the service of the kind and beloved
master, who now lay before them, in all the stillness of death.
In those moments of deep and suffocating grief they almost lost
sight of the consoling and joyful belief that their beloved parent
was then rejoicing in a heaven of pure and unalloyed felicity, but,
as they mingled their tears, the silence of heartfelt sorrow was
interrupted by a sweet and solemn voice, repeating, “Blessed are
the dead, who die in the Lord,” and Sister Helena, as she was
called, a pious Christian recluse, approached and knelt with them,
by the remains of the good old man. Sweet and soothing to their
souls were the prayers and thanksgiving which she poured forth
with fervent earnestness, and they arose from their knees, chastened
and resigned. Cold and insensible must have been the feelings
of those who could have listened to those aspirations unmoved,
or gazed upon the inspired countenance of this extraordinary
female, without almost fancying that she was indeed an
angel of consolation, permitted to sojourn awhile upon earth to
soothe the sorrows of the afflicted, and direct their hopes to that
bright and happy home which she had quitted upon her errand
of love. The brightness of her dark and expressive eyes was contrasted
with the marble whiteness of her complexion, her beautiful
hair, which had formerly graced the most precious pearls,
and adorned costly diamonds, the gifts of royal love, was now
confined by a simple braid, and the form, once decked in imperial
purple, and glittering in courtly magnificence, was now wrapped
in the plainest garb, the simplicity of which could not hid the loveliness
of her form. In a voice of soothing sympathy, she gave
some directions to the sorrowing servants, and then kindly led
the bereaved relations from the chamber of death. “He has departed
in peace,” said she, as they entered a retired chamber,
“may our last end be like this; may we die the death of this righteous
man, and now, dearest friends, the swiftly passing moments
warn me to be quick in what I have to relate. Your minds, I
know, are stayed upon the Rock of Ages, and though I speak of
danger and death, ye will know that the Lord of all the earth will
do right. Brother Ambrose, last night, brought the tidings that
tomorrow is appointed for another of those awful scenes with
which Rome is now familiar, and, though we know that the moment
when the soul of the Christian takes its flight from this
world of sorrow and wickedness is a moment which introduces it
to an eternity of happiness, unalloyed and unspeakable, yet we
turn with shuddering grief, from its accompaniments of pain and
torture.” “Oh, tell me not,” said Cleone, with startling agony of
voice and manner, “say not that our Curtius is condemned,” and
overcome with grief and terror, she sank upon the ground, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
the mother, with her hands clasped, and her eyes raised, prayed
for strength from above. “He is indeed condemned,” said Sister
Helena, “but listen, dear sisters, and see if there is not a ray of
hope to lighten this gloomy hour. After learning these tidings, I
left our retreat immediately to comfort you, if possible, and, with
hasty steps proceeded along the private path which leads from our
secluded dwelling directly by the remains of the ancient temple
upon the hill. While groping my way through the ivy and thick
bushes, I was startled by the sound of voices, proceeding from the
ruins, and the name of the Emperor repeated with the most awful
threats, and joined to the fear of discovery induced me to stop
and conceal myself. That the speakers were bitter enemies to
Nero was evident from their conversation, and, in a short time I
gathered from it that they had entered into a conspiracy, and
bound themselves by solemn oaths to take his life, and, that the
moment of his leaving the amphitheatre, after the executions, was
chosen to effect their purpose, as being a moment of confusion
and dismay. The infamous Caius Piso, whose inveterate hate for
the Emperor is so well known, I discovered, was at the head of
the conspiracy, and their measures are so well concerted that they
must succeed. Now, dear friends, may we not, by warning Nero
of this imminent, this certain danger, save the life of your beloved
Curtius? Listen, Cleone, have you courage to face this cruel
Emperor, and intercede for the life of your brother? And, if he
refuses to grant it to your prayers, yet you may induce him to
mercy by convincing him that the means of saving his own life is
in your power.” “But, do you reflect, Helena, that this inhuman
tyrant may, and most probably would turn a deaf ear to all her
intercessions, and force her, by torture, to confess her knowledge
of this conspiracy? No, it is for me to offer myself a sacrifice
for my son. I will endure every torment he can inflict, and, perhaps,
when convinced that he cannot extort the secret, he will
grant me the life of my child.” “Mother,” said Cleone, throwing
her arms around her neck, “mother, do you doubt my resolution,
my courage, my ability to endure any suffering for the sake
of those so dear to me? Oh, let me go; I will throw myself at
his feet; he cannot resist my supplications; he will be grateful to
us for saving him from sure destruction, and reward us by restoring
my brother to his home and friends.” “Hear me,” said
Sister Helena, “I myself would be the intercessor, were I not certain
that Nero would recognize in me one who has incurred his
mostly deadly hatred, one whom he would not hesitate to sacrifice
to his revengeful passions, and whose entreaties for the life
of the young Christian would only be a passport for his speedy
death. You, madam,” said she, addressing the distressed and almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
fainting mother, “are known as a Christian. You have already
been exposed to the suspicions of Nero, and have but barely
escaped his cruel persecutions by a life of the strictest seclusion.
Your daughter, reared in retirement, and unknown to the world,
would not be so obnoxious, and she might not be unprotected.
The young Flavius, the unswerving friend of Curtius, who has
already braved the indignation of the tyrant, for his sake, would,
without doubt, accompany and support her, and high in rank,
and beloved by all parties, his influence would go far to ensure her
safety. But, we have but moments to deliberate; midnight is the
time appointed for these conspirators to meet and perfect their
plan, and, if we resort to these, I am convinced, only means, to
save the life of this dear friend, Nero must know all in season to
apprehend them together.” “Do not hesitate, mother, dearest,
dearest mother, let me save my brother from this awful death; I
shall be safe; God will protect me; He will aid me to confront
this terrible Nero.” “My Cleone, my darling child, must I expose
you to this danger? Must I thrust you, as it were, into the
jaws of this inhuman monster? Oh, think, dear sister, of his aggravated
cruelties; remember the fate of his own mother and
wife; when has any consideration stayed his barbarity? How can
we expect, how can we even hope that he will lose his grasp of
a victim, so completely in his power? He will sacrifice them both,
and I—I shall be left childless and alone!” Tears of commiseration
streamed from the eyes of the sympathizing recluse. “Be it
as you please,” said she, “I cannot, dare not urge you to a measure
which may indeed end as you fear; although I think it would
be otherwise. I know the disposition of Nero. Alas!” said she,
with shuddering grief, “who should know it so well! Amidst all
his fierce cruelty, he is a very coward by nature, and nothing so
perfectly unmans him as the fear of death.” “Go then, my
Cleone,” said her mother, “if possible, save your brother from this
dreadful doom, and if I am bereaved of both, I will pray that I, too,
may join you in that heaven, where there is no separation.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The evening was now advanced, and Herbert closed the volume.
“How was it possible,” said Susan, “that Valeria, for it
was she, I suppose, who bore the name of Sister Helena, could
have eluded the search of the vindicative Emperor? With his
exasperated feelings, he would leave no means untried to discover
her, and these being joined with his great power, I cannot
imagine how she could have been saved.” “Though the early
Christians,” said Herbert, “when called to give a reason for the
hope that was in them, were bold in conscious innocence, though
they shrank not from danger or death in the service of their Master,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
still, they did not, needlessly, cast away their lives; but, even
with the prudence of worldly wisdom, avoided exposure. Their
residence was often in the most obscure places, in the depths of
gloomy forests, or in caves of the earth, from whence, in the still
hours of night, the sounds of praise and thanksgiving arose to
Him to whom ‘the darkness is as at noonday.’ Many of these
subterranean abodes are still shown, and the inscriptions upon the
rugged walls prove them to have been the homes of the persecuted
Christians.” “I should like to go to Rome,” said Charles,
“and go into those caves, and see the ruins of that great city.”
“And those ancient pavements,” said Mary, “which have been
swept by the imperial purple, and visit the tombs, where rest the
remains of those great and good, of whom we read.” “Now
Mary is upon her hobby,” said Susan, “and she will not stop
short of the Holy Land at least. If she were only an old man,
with a big wig, she would be a most inveterate antiquary.” “I
will sympathize with you, dear Mary,” said Elizabeth, “if to read
of former ages, and their stirring events, excites so much interest,
how delightful to stand upon the spots commemorated in history,
but, above all, to tread in the footsteps of the Saviour, and
visit the scenes hallowed by his presence.” “To stand upon the
Mount of the Olive trees,” said Herbert, “to wander by the brook
Cedron, and through the ancient burial places of the Jews. To
linger by the shores of the sea of Galilee, and mark the swelling
waters, to fix in our ‘mind’s eye’ the very place where Jesus
walked upon the boisterous waves. Come evening, remind me,
Mary, and I will read some lines which may interest you, as being
an admirer of poetry as well as of these remembrances of bygone
days.”</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Wilson lived in comparative retirement, yet her
house was the abode of hospitality. Many valuable friends of her
younger years, and of her husband, still kept up that friendly
intercourse which had always been a source of pleasure and improvement;
and among them were many, not only the most pious,
but the most enlightened and amiable characters of the day. In
their society the young people became accustomed to that true
politeness, that delicate wit and refined conversation which is the
sure index of good breeding and high intellect. While surrounded
by visitors of this class they could not so much regret the loss
of their evening entertainments, and, when left with only their
own domestic circle, they returned to them with renewed enjoyment.
Some evenings had elapsed during one of those pleasant
seasons of visiting, and the continuation of the Tale, which had
so interested them, had been necessarily delayed, but at length
the time arrived when they were again alone and at liberty to
pursue their course of reading.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“The moonbeams shone in rich splendor upon the massy walls
and towers of the imperial palace and illumed the glittering arms
of the guard who surrounded it. Preparations for a feast were
going on and strains of soft music were heard within. Its magnificent
apartments were blazing with light and sparkling with
gold and silver ornaments and the fragrance of the scented draperies
diffused itself through their vast extent. In an inner chamber,
more gorgeously decorated, and hung with cloth of gold, the
bordering of which was heavy with jewels, reclined upon a luxurious
couch the infamous Nero, the lord of all this splendor,
but despised and contemned by even the meanest of his subjects.
His purple robe hung in rich folds over the silver drapery of his
couch, his long, perfumed hair was parted over his white forehead,
displaying an effeminate countenance which, to a casual
observer, would show none of those traits of revengeful malice
or diabolical cruelty which were the characteristics of the despotic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Emperor. His jeweled fingers pressed lightly the strings of a
lute and the careless indolence of his attitude expressed total indifference
to everything excepting his own ease. A few attendants
stood at the door and his favorite freedman waited near
the couch to receive the first indications of his pleasure. “Anicetus,”
said he, at length, raising his heavy eyes, in the expression
of which alone might be seen the evil passions of his nature,
“did you instruct my guards to admit the woman whom we encountered
at the bath?” “I did, mighty Emperor,” was the answer.
“Repeat to me the words of her address.” “My lord, to
the best of my recollection, these were her very words: ‘The star
of thy nativity wanes; wouldst thou know more? admit me ere
thy revel begins.’” The complexion of Nero grew paler as he
said in a low tone: “Dost thou believe in the prophetic gifts of
these Sybils?” “The star of Nero will always be in the ascendant,”
said the freedman. “Is not his word the law of Rome? and not
of Rome only, but of the whole world?” and he bowed to the
ground in cringing servility. “Nevertheless, I would hear what
this woman would reveal; see that she is admitted at the time.
Some wine, Anicetus. What insufferable insolence in Servius
Galba to interfere in the execution of my will! His haughty
ambition requires pruning. <em>Reprieve!</em> pardon the arrogant Christian,
who has dared to brave my power! No! by Jupiter, the extremest
tortures shall punish his audacity; we will see if his demeanor
will retain its insulting composure. Are all my orders
executed? Is everything in readiness?” “Everything, my noble
lord; all has been prepared according to your directions, and
your decree to that effect has been given to the impudent Christian,
who will have the night to contemplate the certainty of his deserved
fate.” “It is ’well,” said Nero, and a malignant smile
passed across his features and, while carelessly tuning his instrument,
his thoughts were apparently rioting in the prospect of the
gratification of his revenge. At this moment the woman, who,
by his order was suffered to enter, appeared at the door of the
apartment. As the freedman met her with an impatient gesture,
she waved him aside and, with a firm step and commanding air,
advanced to the couch, from which Nero had started. The same
dark and piercing eyes were fixed upon him which had terrified
Cleone and the same deep and hollow voice sounded in his
ear. “The decree of Fate is even now passing; the fiat of justice
is being issued; thou, who hast arrogated to thyself the powers
of life and death at the dictates of thine own base passions,
tremble before a Power in whose sight thou art but as a grain
of dust, more degraded than the meanest worm of the ground
thou hast polluted. The Sun of the universe will arise, but not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
for thee; the breeze of the mountains will refresh all nature, but
its healthful influence will impart no life to thine inanimate form;
Emperor of Rome! the sands of your life are few and fast ebbing!”
Nero had stood motionless and as she stayed her denunciations
he sank again upon his couch, but a moment elapsed,
when rage and anger glowed in his countenance, before pale as
marble. “Wretch!” said he, “thy fate is sealed, tortures and death
await thee.” Unshrinkingly she stood before the tyrant, unawed
she witnessed his deadly rage. “Yet retrace thy steps,” she said,
“man of many crimes, while yet in thy power repair those evils
which have not passed beyond thy influence. From the deep
abyss of thy guilt and infamy look up; for, far through the
fearful gloom the rays of the sweet star of mercy <em>may</em> reach even
thee. For me, I am beyond your power; you can neither save nor
destroy me. Nero, to purchase the slender chance for mercy
which is yet yours I would barter life and yield it amidst all the
torments the art of man could inflict. But my time has elapsed;
we meet no more on earth.” So saying, before the dismayed Emperor
could collect his scattered thoughts, she passed from the
apartment and from the astonished gaze of the attendants who,
though distant spectators of the scene, had not heard what had
passed. “Draw near, Anicetus,” said Nero, as his freedman approached.
“Where did Galba direct his steps when he left our
presence? I liked not his haughty bearing.” “To the Senate
chamber, my lord.” “Ha! are the Senate together tonight? for
what purpose?” “I know not, most mighty Emperor; the doors
of the chamber are closed.” “The slaves! do they dare?” He
strode the apartment with hasty steps, his cheeks blanched with
passion. “Discover,” said he, “the cause of this secret sitting;
by my head, they shall dearly rue this audacity. Bring me the
report without delay.” The freedman bent his body in obedience
and withdrew. Left alone, the restless motions and perturbed
demeanor of the Emperor expressed the agitation of his
mind. At times he would gnash his teeth in anger, then strong
lines of terror and dismay would cross his features. At length,
throwing himself upon the couch, he covered his face with his
hands and appeared lost in thought. The lowliest goatherd
among the Appenines, who, lying down at night with but the
hard ground for a pillow and a canopy of boughs for a shelter,
knows not where to find his daily food, was happier than this
lord of Italy. Of what avail was all this pomp to him, whose
splendid robes covered a heart beating with terror and alarm?
The abode of suspicion and fear, torn with the pangs of dark
remorse, but still raging with the most horrid passions, to gratify
which the country which he was bound to serve and protect was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
made to bleed at every pore? The meanest serf, the most degraded
slave throughout this vast empire would have refused to
exchange situations with this lordly tyrant could they have realized
the horrors of his guilty conscience. At one moment he
would devise means to crush the Senate at a single blow; then
the words of the Sybil, recurring to his mind, the idea of conciliation
would be uppermost, and, though his whole frame trembled
with impotent rage, yet he would determine to practise his powers
of dissimulation and defer the gratification of his revenge
to a more fitting opportunity. The superstitious terrors of his
intellect were all aroused, his cowardly heart quailed at the
shadow of coming events which he knew would overwhelm him,
and his revengeful passions were all in wild commotion.</p>

<p>A slave, bending before him, announced Lucius Flavius, and,
collecting his thought, and endeavoring to smooth his brow to
composure, he ordered that the patrician should be admitted.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Herbert was here interrupted by the call of some persons upon
business which might detain him some time, to the great annoyance
of the little party. A pleasant conversation, however, commenced
upon the influence of superstition over mankind throughout
all ages of the world. “Even in our enlightened age,” said
Mrs. Wilson, “we find many who are slaves to superstition in
some of its various forms, but its influence is milder and gradually
decreasing. Within a century and a half persons whose
minds were enlightened, of undoubted piety, and who would
have smiled in derision at the superstitious observances of the
ancient Romans, professed full faith in witchcraft, that most terrific
of all delusions.” “Oh,” said Mary, “I never hear the relation
of those times without a shudder. What could have been
the cause of such frightful credulity?” “It is shrouded in mystery,”
said Mrs. Wilson, “and, probably, in this world we shall
never know. Let us be thankful that no vestiges of such infatuation
are left, but the sad spot where so many victims to its maddening
influence perished.” “Even here,” said Elizabeth, “we
are not exempted from this universal passion; we, too, have had
our renowned fortune teller.” “Oh, yes,” said Susan, “I overheard
Phoebe, the other day, gravely recounting the wonderful
predictions of this redoubtable Sybil.” “Was Moll Pitcher a
Sybil?” said Charles. “She would have passed for one in ancient
times, Charles,” said his mother, “and, with her shrewd countenance
and small, black eyes, aided by her red cloak and hood,
might, I think, have played her part quite respectably. Her
dwelling, too, would be appropriate for such a character; desolate
and dreary, at the foot of the high rock, and embellished with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
a tall memento of one of the monsters of the ocean, the rib of a
whale. I will read some lines upon her name and character by
some witty poet of the day:</p>

<p>“Did you ever see a witch, mother?” said Charles. “If you will
listen, my son, I will tell you a story, the only one relating to a
witch, which ever came to my certain knowledge.</p>

<p>“When I was a tiny school girl there stood a lonely little house
at the foot of a rising ground on the direct road to our school
house; there were no trees about it, but a few choke berries and
alder bushes, for there was a marshy piece of ground there. A
very small lot was cultivated as a garden by the hands of its only
inhabitant, poor old ‘Aunt Lois,’ as everybody called her. Nobody
knew any harm of Aunt Lois, but every body said ‘Certainly
she was a witch.’ The time had passed when witches were
hanged or burned, so Aunt Lois lived peaceably in her own home,
but many wonderful stories were told about her, such as that she
was seen churning butter in the night, and, though nothing could
be nicer or sweeter than her butter, yet some wise people asserted
‘that she must have help about it which nobody knew of.’ Old
Joe Hart said that he had seen a company of witches, riding on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
broomsticks through the air, with Aunt Lois at their head with
a cap and long cloak on, and a wand in her hand. This, he said
was “just as true as anything he ever said in all his life,” but
as Joe was noted for telling great stories, people would have
been glad of better authority. But no part of the community
was more troubled about these stories than the children belonging
to the school, and, though the boys blustered a good deal and
said ‘Who’s afraid?’ yet it was observed that they always kept
the side of the lane farthest from Aunt Lois’s house; and, as to
the girls, they would scramble over the fence and run through a
swamp rather than go near it. An event, however, occurred
which not only quieted their fears, but even made Lois popular
in their opinion. It was a warm afternoon in the summer, when
a little troop of boys and girls were returning from school, when
they espied among the wet ground at the foot of the hill, near
the old woman’s house, a cluster of beautiful lilies. Never were
any wild flowers so much sought for as those lilies, for they were
very scarce and of rare and beautiful colors. ‘I know I can get
some,’ said Catherine, and, followed closely by two others, she
bounded over the low wall and, without taking thought of the
swamp, she sprang forward to be the first to gain the wished-for
prize. But soon the ground began to give way beneath her feet,
but she had almost gained the flowers, and, supposing that by one
more leap she should gain sure footing, she jumped forward,
but down she sank, deep, deep in the mire, and there she was
planted, unable to stir her feet, and imagining her little body was
going, too, she did not know where. She was near enough to
clasp the tall stems of the lilies and clung to them as if for support,
but the slender roots gave way and, though she had gained
the desired objects, yet she would joyfully have given them up to
her frightened companions, who had stopped just before they
arrived at the fatal spot, could she have been safe with them. ‘Do
help me, Martha; do take my hand, Susie,’ screamed the little
girl, but when they dare not come further and were turning
back, she began to sob and cry most piteously. But, just then,
terrible to behold, Aunt Lois’s door opened and, to our great
dismay, she appeared. What a scampering now ensued! The
boys jumped over the wall and the girls ran, without looking back,
until they had gained what they considered a safe distance from
the dreaded spot, but the little girl was left, unable to stir. She
covered her face with her hands to shut out the sight of the old
witch, but she heard her step and the terror of she knew not
what almost took away her senses. ‘For mercy’s sake, my little
dear,’ said Aunt Lois, ‘why did you come into this wet, boggy
place? I don’t know as I can get to you, but put out your hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
If I should get stuck here, too, we should be in a pickle.’ Catherine
obeyed, for the voice of Aunt Lois sounded kind and pleasant,
and, with a strong pull, she extricated the little girl, but a
sad sight was displayed. Her feet were black with the mud of
the swamp, but, her shoes being tied on, she did not lose them.
And now, to the great terror of the children, who were watching
from their hiding places, Lois carried the little girl into her house,
and solemn was the consultation as we gathered together and
debated upon her fate. Such long and dismal faces are seldom
seen, such terrible stories were told as made the eyes of the
younger children dilate with dismay. But at this moment the
little Catherine was seen running toward us. ‘Aunt Lois isn’t
a witch,’ said she, ‘see, she has washed my shoes and the bottom
of my dress, and she has given me some doughnuts and some
apples, and picked me a whole bunch of lilies.’ The charm was
at an end. Aunt Lois’s cake and apples were eaten with great
relish and, ever after, in the opinion of the children, Aunt Lois
was ‘a grand, good old woman.’”</p>

<p>“I wish all witch stories would end as well as this,” said Susan.
“And that all witches were as good as Aunt Lois,” said Charles.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p>A bright, clear, cold Sabbath morning dawned. The smooth
snow sparkled as if sprinkled with diamonds, and the bracing atmosphere
seemed to infuse new life into creation. The strict
habits of our Puritan fathers, in regard to public worship, were
not forgotten in the family of Mrs. Wilson, and, when, all meeting
at their social evening conversation, many remarks were made
upon the exercises of the day, no carping criticisms, no sarcastic
observations were indulged in, or would have been permitted.
Ministers, in those days, were both loved and reverenced; loved
for themselves, and reverenced for their holy vocation, and, generally
grew old among a people to whom they were attached by
the strongest ties, whose interests were theirs, and whose children
were considered their own. There is no more beautiful description
of a country clergyman, and none that more generally applies
to the times of which I am writing, than Goldsmith’s. The
pastors, in those days, literally “allured to brighter worlds, and
led the way.”</p>

<p>After a day spent in listening to the words of one of those
emphatically good men, the evening fire was surrounded by our
little company, who were comparing notes upon the services of the
day. The subject was Christ choosing his disciples, and, one of
the remarks of one of the speakers was, that because the first followers
of Christ were probably illiterate men, it should not be
inferred that learning was not necessary for ministers of the present
day. Almighty power could inspire them with wisdom, without
human means, and, that was then the case, but the miraculous
interposition of Providence was not now granted, therefore, education
was a most useful auxiliary to piety. An interesting conversation
upon the subject then ensued. At length Mary reminded
Herbert of his promise to read them some poetry, and he read
as follows:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And the mingled sounds of busy life re-echoed from its banks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here Naz’reth’s populous city stretched its crowded noisy street,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there Capernaum’s lofty towers the passing traveler greet;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here the wild fig tree bends beneath its luscious watery load,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there the light green olive spreads around the mountain side.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh! chosen land; how lovely then thy hills and valleys seemed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That ’midst such beauty dwelt such sin, ah! who would then have deemed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon those waves, one humble bark was making for the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Weary and faint, its inmates joyed as they approached the strand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A life of toil and scanty fare, these humble fishers led,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, wearily and patiently they earned their daily bread;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The careless glance would scarce remark aught in their aspect rude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save the dull look of untaught men, in discontented mood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But observations practiced eye, would trace the lines of thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the sedate intelligence of minds with wisdom fraught;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would mark the quick and varying glance of passion, strong and deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though, now, within the calm, cold breast, the stormy feelings sleep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would note the traces of that zeal, which oft in after days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glowed in those hearts, and warmed the world by its reflected blaze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which led those men, so humble now, with firm and dauntless mien,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tortures to brave, and even death, with hearts firm and serene;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But why their looks of earnest awe, now bent towards the shore?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why are those features roused to life, so still and calm before?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mark you, on yonder point that form? is it of earth or heaven?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though lowly are his robes, such grace is not to mortals given,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy coast, O favored Galilee! Such foot ne’er pressed before;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such voice, O lovely lake! ne’er waked the echoes of thy shore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mark but that pure and holy brow, where heaven’s own perfect peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sits calm enthroned, and bids the world’s tumultuous passions cease.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That eye, whose quick and piercing glance, whose full and brilliant light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Searches each heart, and reads each thought of those who meet its sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then listen to that sacred voice, that simple ‘Follow me.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aye, blessed Jesus, aye; through life, to death, we follow thee;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such is the quick, the glad response, their earnest gesture shows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See, in their looks the free assent, e’er from their lips it flows,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peter! thy dark and flashing eye, thy lips compressed and stern,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Says ‘though all men forsake thee, Lord, yet is my purpose firm’;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it was firm, though the dark tempter sought, by many a wile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lure him from his plighted faith, and lead his heart to guile;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes; it was firm, for with his blood he made the compact sure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, on the Rock of Peter’s faith, the church will rest secure.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The waters of that hallowed lake still wash that honored shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still o’er its waves the setting sun does his bright radiance pour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But on its dark blue surface glides no solitary bark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And o’er that once fair land, a cloud hangs heavily and dark.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven has received again to bless that pure and blessed One,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His chosen martyred followers, too, victory o’er Death have won,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But memory hangs, with cherished love, round scenes his presence blest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And dwells with fond affection on the soil his footsteps pressed.”</div>

</div>

<p>“I like very much to hear Herbert read poetry,” said Charles.
“Mother, may he read those lines called ‘Early Recollections?’
They refer to scenes in our own town, Susan, and I know you
will like them.” “Why should Susan like them more than the
rest of us, Charles?” said Mary. “Oh. I think they are more
suited to her taste.” “I must certainly hear them,” said Susan,
“if it were only to know whether Charles has judged rightly of
my taste.” “I will endeavor to find them tomorrow,” said Mrs.
Wilson, “and I hope they will serve to amuse you.” At the first
convenient opportunity Herbert continued the tale of the early
Christians.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The delicious coolness of the evening breeze, after a day of
uncommon heat was, of itself, a temptation sufficient to draw
many into the open air, and the streets of Rome were thronged
with her citizens. Here might be seen the rich carriage, borne
by slaves in livery, on whose soft and luxurious cushions reclined
the haughty noble; there, the patrician, with his train of attendants,
and the wealthy plebean, conscious of his inferior rank, but
emulating the proud bearing of his rival. Chairs and litters
passed in quick succession, and freed men and slaves jostled each
other. From the stately palaces resounded the notes of revelry
and mirth, and from the theatres, the sounds of music and dancing.
In the opening, before one of the courts, were gathered a
crowd of listeners, around one of those gifted poets, who, without
forethought, composed and recited upon any given subject,
with ease and gracefulness, and are rewarded not only by gratuities
of money, but by the rapturous applause of their hearers.
Through one of the streets passed a funeral procession, for, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Rome, all their funeral ceremonies were performed by torchlight
and much pomp and parade was displayed upon the occasion in
honor of the deceased. Thus life, with its shifting scenes, its
hopes and fears and conflicting passions, were, at this time, in
full contrast with the startling reality of death; though few heeded
the solemn warning. A hasty glance, some words of condolence
or commendation of the deceased, and the proud pageant
was forgotten. Amidst all this bustling confusion might be seen
some, apparently persons of distinction, whose air of mystery and
whispering conferences portended some event of importance.
Two citizens met near the Temple of Fortune; “Health and happiness,
noble Varro,” said a rich patrician to a stately noble, “may
the deities be propitious; have you heard the rumor?” “I have
been witnessing the betrothal of my son to the daughter of Publius
Dentatus, and have heard no rumor. Of what nature?” “A
most happy betrothal; may their years be auspicious! The reports
are of a most astounding character. It is rumored that the
Senate, in full council, have condemned Nero, and, that Servius
Galba, so lately returned from Spain, will be chosen, by the soldiery,
as his successor.” “And, would Galba be the choice of the
Senate, Licinius?” “Perhaps not, but he is the favorite of the
legions from Spain, and beloved by the soldiers, generally, and
they could find no fault with the choice, unless it be the severity
of his manners.” “He is a good and honorable man,” said the
elder, “but he will find the rank and title of Emperor but a thin
gilding to the bitter pill of royalty he must swallow. But, the
world will last our day, Licinius, let the wheel go round.” And
they parted. At the turning of one of the streets, a knot of citizens
were conferring. “How is this, Sempronius?” said one,
“what will be the consequence of this decree of condemnation, of
which we hear so many rumors? Will the Emperor abdicate, or
have his enemies determined upon his death?” “Vengeance will
not always sleep, fellow citizens,” said the one who was addressed;
“Who is not an enemy to the detestable vices of Nero? and what
wickedness is there in the whole catalogue of crime which he has
not committed?” “Nay, Sempronius,” said a man with a stern and
forbidding countenance, “he has done good service to the State,
by exterminating those Christians.” “By our household deities,”
said another, “I know not that, for the sect is like the Hydra of
old, as fast as one is exterminated, as you say, a score appear in
his place. I am for stopping these executions at once, and then
we shall see if this heresy will not die of itself.” “But, said the
first speaker, “will not Nero set the Senate at defiance? He
has his favorites, and may yet make a stand.” “Not so,” said
Sempronius, “his nature is cowardly, and at the first intimation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of danger, he would shrink from it with terror. He needs no
accuser but his own guilty conscience; he has waded in the blood
of innocence, and will yet be deluged in its avenging waves.” The
company dispersed, each in his several path.</p>

<p>With a hurried step, the freedman of Nero was seen ascending
the steps of the palace; he was greeted by one of his fellow servants,
“Whither so fast, Anicetus? One would think the
avenger was at thy heels.” “He is,” said the freedman. “There
is something wrong in the wind,” said the questioner, “there is
some cause for so much stir and commotion in the city,” continued
he, addressing one of the guards, “and the military, without the
walls are in motion, for the trumpets have sounded.” “Well,”
said the other, “let what will come, my duty lies here.”</p>

<p>We will now return to the entrance of Lucius Flavius into the
apartment of Nero, in the imperial palace. With a firm and
lofty step, but a respectful demeanor, the young and noble defender
of innocence, advanced, supporting the sister of Curtius,
who, though her complexion was pale, and her form tremulous
with emotion, shrank not from the haughty and insolent regard of
the tyrant. “How is this, my Lord Lucius; what fair votary of
Venus have you introduced to our presence with so little ceremony?
Methinks some more formal introduction were befitting
so much beauty.” “Innocence, my Lord, the Emperor, may be
always confident in its own resources, and sorrow has claims superior
to all formal observances. The maiden before you is the
sister of Quintius Curtius, and her errand is to solicit, even yet,
the life and freedom of her brother.” Cleone slid from the arm
of her protector, and bent her knee before Nero. “We are
orphans,” said she, “my brother and myself, children of one of
Rome’s noblest citizens. Our father fought his country’s battles,
defended her liberty and gloried in her prosperity. Our ancestors
gave their lives and treasures for her benefit, and my brother
would yield his heart’s blood for the welfare of his native land;
we are alone in the world; noble Emperor, grant me the life of
my brother.” The sweet pleading tones of her voice, the earnest
expressions of her eyes, would, it would seem, have produced
some feeling, even in the hard heart of Nero; such was not the
case. With a malignant sneer, he said: “And so permit him to
convert you, fair damsel, to the faith of the Nazarene? By the
beard of Silenus, that would be sacrilege to bind so alluring an
object in the galling chains of that cynical sect. Not so, my
beautiful grace; love for our country influences us to cleanse it of
these fanatical reformers, who are attempting to subvert its established
principles, and overturn our faith in a religion which has
stood the test of ages. He must suffer for his obstinacy; but, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
you, fair maiden, you shall be under especial care and protection.”
With an indignant gesture, Flavius attempted to raise Cleone, but,
resisting the effort, her eyes flashing, and her voice becoming
more firm, “Yet a moment, haughty Emperor, your life is in my
power,”—“What! ho, help here, slaves!” “Stay, Emperor,”
said Flavius, “there is a secret conspiracy against your life, accidentally
discovered. She only can tell you the names of the conspirators,
and its details. Give to her prayers the life of her
brother, and your life may be preserved.” “Refuse me,” said
Cleone, “and, so sure as you are now living, so certain is your destruction.”
A scowl of rage distorted the countenance of Nero.
“There are ways, my haughty young dame, to compel such refractory
tempers to confession.” “Before your cruel purpose
could be executed,” said Cleone, “the time would have elapsed
when your life might be saved. Death is fearful to all, were it
only for the uncertainty of the prospect beyond. Is your conscience
so pure that you dare look upon its near approach without
alarm? Will you not shrink from encountering its gloom, to
you the dark mystery of the future?” She was interrupted by
the hasty entrance of the freedman, who, bending low before the
Emperor, addressed to him some communication, which, first
suffusing his face with crimson, soon left it of a deadly paleness.
Fear and irresolution marked his features. He gave some hasty
orders, and appeared lost in thought for a short time. At length,
seeming to have formed a determination, he turned to Flavius.
“Young lord,” said he, “time does not admit of delay; let this
maiden give me, in a few words, the outline of this conspiracy,
and then, upon one condition, I will release the Christian.” “Give
us an order to that effect, my lord Emperor, and you shall know
all,” and, while Cleone trembled between hope and fear, Nero
wrote upon a leaf of his tablets, “Release the Christian prisoner,
Quintius Curtius,” and tearing it from the book, affixed his seal,
and gave the order to Flavius. Hurry and dismay marked his
motions, and, turning to Cleone, he commanded her to make the
disclosure. In a clear, distinct manner, she related the circumstances,
and mentioned Caius Piso as the principal conspirator.
He muttered between his teeth, “Let me but escape this first danger,
and I will defy Piso and his retainers.” “Go,” said he, aloud,
“leave the presence, yet, stay, Lucius Flavius, the condition is not
yet complied with.” In a low constrained voice, he said, “I have
just received intelligence of an insurrection in the army without
the walls, and that the traitors have expressed their determination
of deposing me, and electing Servius Galba. I know not how far
the discontent extends, perhaps the Senate have dared to connive
at it,” and his frame trembled, and he grew more deadly pale.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
“The condition I make with you is, that, if they presume to aim
at my life, you will intercede. Use your influence with Galba,
do you understand, do you engage to this?” “I do,” said Flavius,
“as I hope for mercy myself.” “Enough,” said Nero. Almost
dreading the reality of this sudden and happy change, Cleone left
the presence of this dreaded tyrant of Rome; and he was left
alone with his miserable thoughts; the remembrance of the past,
the horrors of his dark deeds of cruelty, mingling with dismal
forebodings of future retribution. Starting in his hurried walk
he listened with breathless attention to the distant sounds in the
city. Again, pacing the apartment in agitation, he would mutter
low and almost inaudible exclamations, “No guests arrive; that
is, of it itself, suspicious; the traitors! They will all forsake me;
yes, I will leave the city, without delay; but, whither? To my
country house; that will do, and let the excitement subside. It
was well to conciliate this Flavius by releasing the Christian; his
influence may do much; that Sybil! Her prophecy weighs heavy
upon me; where have I seen her dark visage before?” Then he
threw himself upon his couch; but, directly springing up, “What
is this?” said he, “I seem sinking into an abyss? Is there a future
after death? Ho! Anicetus.” As the freedman entered, he said,
“Are all things prepared? Have you secured my treasures?”
“All is prepared, my lord, and waiting your command.” “You,
at least, Anicetus, have no reason to complain of me; can I trust
you?” “I will be faithful to you till the last, my master.” “It is
well,” said Nero, “hasten our immediate departure; if I live, you
shall not repent your fidelity.”</p>

<p>“My dear mother,” said Herbert, as Mrs. Wilson took her
usual place the next evening, “we desire your opinion. Does the
fact that we read this story at intervals lessen its interest?” “It
would not in my opinion,” said Mrs. Wilson. “I think a story,
read in this manner, affords more real pleasure and instruction
than the common practice, when the faculties become tired by the
continued strain. It is a species of intoxication which, after the
excitement is ended, leaves the mind tired and exhausted by over-exertion.”
“I dare say you are right, dear aunt,” said Susan, “but
I confess that I was disposed to quarrel with such a truth when
Herbert told us he must be absent this evening, and I do not like
to have Charles disappointed.” “Charles must learn to bear disappointments,”
said his mother, smiling at his earnest and sober
look. “I have found the lines you wished to have read, my son,
and we will spend the evening in reading them.” “But,” said
Charles, “I wish the good young Christian was released from his
dreary dungeon.” “Never mind, dear Charles,” said Herbert,
“the anticipation of happiness is very pleasant, you know.” “Yes,”
said Elizabeth, “but you remember we have the very best authority
for saying that ‘hope deferred maketh the heart sick.’” “There
seems to be no alternative,” said Mrs. Wilson, “and we will endeavor
to evade this heart-sickness by diverting your attention
to other objects, even the pleasant scenes of our own home.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent14">The remembrance of our youth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is as a summer day, and brighter gleams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the dark shadow of our life grows deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no home so dear to us as that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which reared our childhood, and its pleasant scenes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rise, dear to memory’s eye. Those old trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under whose shade our merry sports went on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are dear as ancient friends. My early home!</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">While memory lives, thy peaceful, happy scenes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will never be forgot. From that green lane</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Extends a pathway, bordered with wild shrubs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ascending to the summit of a Rock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Rock of fame, surnamed the “Lover’s Leap.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not this, the Rock of old, whence Sappho sprang,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, plunging in the cold and pitiless flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ended, at once, her love, and her sad life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For no deep water, flowing at the base</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of this steep Rock, offers so quick a cure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For hopeless love, nor do I know, in truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That hapless lover ever tried this leap;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, so much have I heard, that an old cow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moved by some cause which never can be known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approached too near the brink, perhaps to graze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the scanty grass, or the wild box</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which grew among its fissures, and, sad fate!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By a misstep, losing her balance, fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lost her precious life; precious, no doubt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To some good, thrifty farmer’s wife, whose store</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wholesome milk was thus diminished quite.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But nought have I to do with these sad tales</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of death; I love to think of those bright, happy days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, with a gay and happy troop of friends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All happy, we patrolled the pleasant path</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And rested on that Rock, and sang sweet songs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And laughed and talked, and wove gay wreaths of flowers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How pleasant ’twas to watch the different shades</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the green foliage of the large, thick trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Encircling the gray Rock, and mark the view</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the rich landscape, stretching far and wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, in the distance, rolled the vast expanse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of ocean, mingling with the dark blue sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is another Rock, not like this one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surrounded by green shade, but smooth and bare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And High Rock is its name; a beacon this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seen from afar, and, from its highest point,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A lovely prospect opens to the sight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the declivity a Building stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An object of much awe to children’s eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Powder House, a magazine of wrath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, when a child, I almost feared to touch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest all its hidden terrors would explode;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, lower yet, an Aqueduct, whose spring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of clear, cold water, was a welcome treat</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">On a warm summer day; years bring great change,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet much I hope that spot is still unchanged.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One strong remembrance of that pleasant spot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now presses on my mind, for, at its foot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the eastern side, stood a lone house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Deserted, too, it looked, but ’twas not so;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, though no pleasant signs of busy life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were there, yet its patched windows showed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some one had there sought shelter from the cold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas the far-famed Moll Pitcher’s house, the scene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of many an hour of mirth, and some of pain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The would-be prophetess, in sullen mood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would sometimes vex her votaries, boding ill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of future times. I well remember once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Standing upon that Rock, with a gay group</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of young companions, and in merry play,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joining with them in rolling down the steep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shower of stones toward Moll Pitcher’s house;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, as we played, the wind began to rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And some faint hearts among our little clan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Said the old witch had raised the wind in spite.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hearts beat quick with childish fear. At once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We left our sport and, running down the hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the dread fear that the weird woman’s rage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would yet o’ertake us, slackened not our speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Until the friendly shelter of a house</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Received our weary little frames at last.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let not the wise deride our infant fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where is the heart that has not beat sometime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At some dark, superstitious thought of ill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Impending; or the cheek that has not blanched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At some dread mystery yet unexplained?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where are those gay and loved companions now?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do they yet cluster round the same bright hearth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That blessed their childhood? Do they linger still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among those lovely scenes of early youth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So fresh in my remembrance? Ah! how few</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are left to cherish the old memories!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some, the dear playmates of my youthful days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rest in that sacred spot where the tall trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wave a kind requiem o’er the loved remains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of many a cherished one, and others roam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the far western land or sunny south</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where other friends, or other loves, are theirs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A changing world is this, and if our hearts</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are here, how frail our tenure holds.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twould seem, in those young, happy days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There dwelt no sin or sorrow; simple joys</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were ours; the summer morning walk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the fresh air was perfumed with sweet flowers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wild Rose and the Sweetbrier, the sweet Fern,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Bayberry and Box; all lent their aid.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was an ancient wall whose mossy stones</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were almost hid by the luxuriant growth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the wild Grape; and the green spreading leaf</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the low blackberry, climbing o’er its top;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, interspersed among its kindred sweets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rich, black thimbleberry found a place.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There have I strayed, what time the glorious sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose from the ocean, and his splendid hues</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crimsoned the wide horizon, and supplied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My morning bowl of milk with a rich treat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of juicy berries, breathing the fresh air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inhaling health with every passing breeze.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And even when winter, with its freezing breath,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chilled the whole atmosphere, when the green shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sweet flowers were gone, new pleasures came.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The smooth and polished ice, the hard, white snow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sparkling in the bright beams of the clear sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Afforded sport for many a winter day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when, at evening, the gay, cheerful fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Called us around it by its kindly warmth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When dear relations and loved friends were met,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Encircling its clear blaze, then was the hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most coveted, the hour when harmless mirth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Improving converse and the merry glee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of happy childhood joined in sweet accord.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How often have I listened at that hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the sweet song, the lively jest, and oft</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the sad tale of shipwreck, or some tale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of other times, when our forefathers came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From distant lands, where wicked rulers sought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their overthrow, and came to worship God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In these, then, dreary wilds, in their own way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How the dark, stealthy Indian sought their lives;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sickness and famine preyed upon their health,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And death removed their loved and dearest ones;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And made them a great people, and that now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When we behold their populous towns, their lands</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of rich fertility, and happy homes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We know the Lord had led them here for good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And prospered all their hands had sought to do.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis the sweet morn of early youth that fits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our hearts for useful life; let but our home</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be the resort of love and peace, of trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the wise providence of God, and years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will not efface the deep, strong memory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though we may wander from the rightful way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We never shall forget the well taught way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And conscience, like a trusty friend, will point</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the abode of peace and lead us there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Land of our birth! our own America!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May thy fair sons, as plants of goodly growth,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Thy lovely daughters be thy pride and boast.</div>

<p>“You shall select poetry for me, Charles,” said Susan, “since
you so justly appreciate my taste. In the summer we will retrace
these pleasant scenes.” “I know them all,” said Charles, “and
many more I will show you, Susan.” “There are many lovely
spots around us,” said Elizabeth, “and the history of some of them
connected with the early settlement of the town.” “Do you remember,
Charles, that in our ride last summer I pointed out to
you a delightful situation situated upon a point of land projecting
into the ocean?” “Yes, mother, and Elizabeth said it would not
be so pleasant in the winter on account of its exposure to the sea.”
“I will relate a circumstance connected with that situation, which
must conclude our evening’s entertainment. An English gentleman,
the younger son of a noble family, determined to leave his
native land and settle in America. His fortune, which was not
sufficient to support him in England in that style and opulence
which he thought consistent with the dignity of his family, would
be ample in America for all the luxuries of life. He had married
a young and lovely wife and did not find much difficulty in persuading
her to follow his fortunes; but she overestimated her
strength when she bade farewell to the home of her birth, the
friends of her childhood. She suffered much from sickness during
her voyage and, weakened both in body and mind, landed
upon this, to her, a home of strangers. That sickness of the
heart, which we emphatically term homesickness, seized her; she
became melancholy and unhappy and even the soothing affection
of her husband failed to disperse the deep gloom of her mind.
With the hope that change of scene would benefit and amuse her,
he made frequent excursions in the country around Salem, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
they then resided, and one of these was in the neighborhood of
the situation I showed you. She immediately recognized a resemblance
to the scenes of her youth, her first home. The mansion
of her birth stood upon the seashore, the sound of the rushing
waters was like the lullaby of her infancy, and the rugged
rocks were associated in her ideas with those around her own
loved home in England. Delighted that she had found a spot
congenial to her feelings, her husband caused the building which
you saw to be erected, and, adopting it as another home, she became
tranquil and happy, lived beloved and respected and reared
a family of children, some of whose descendants still reside upon
the same spot.” “It is not always local situation which causes
this deep attachment to home,” said Mary. “It is wisely ordered
that it should not be so,” said Mrs. Wilson. “Mother,” said
Charles, “may I repeat those lines upon our native land?” “Do
so,” said his mother.</p>

<p>At the first convenient opportunity Herbert resumed the tale of
the early Christians.</p>

<p>From the scenes of confusion we have described, we will return
to the Appian palace, where lay, in peaceful rest, the remains
of its honored master. The domestics were busied in preparing
the funeral honors for one, so revered and beloved; some
in arranging boughs of Cypress before the doors; others in adorning,
with rare and beautiful flowers, the couch of the deceased, or
in distributing aromatic plants about the apartment. The soft
night breeze stole through the open windows, the air seeming to
breath the sweet peace which surrounded the deathbed of the
aged saint. The heart of one mourner in this quiet mansion, was
bowed down with grief, but she was not left alone with her sorrows;
the kind recluse remained with her, shared her grief, and
sought to soothe her anguish. Absorbed in their anxieties, they
sat in the portico, which commanded a view of the imperial palace,
and, upon the steps, with her dark eyes fixed upon them,
sat the female, whose predictions caused the guilty tyrant to
tremble; but the wild expression of her eye was now softened,
and her whole aspect changed. “He has gone to his rest,” said
she, “and light and gentle will the sod repose upon his breast, for
it was the abode of kindness, and sweet will be the requiem over
his remains, for it will be the lamentation of the poor and afflicted.”
Then, turning to Sister Helena, to whom she did not
seem a stranger, she said, “The spirit of the good and just must
ascend to the heaven of your faith; but where is the final resting
place of the guilty soul?” “Mother,” said she, “there is time
left for us, who are still inhabitants of earth, to repent and forsake
our sins.” “Say you so?” said the woman, and her earnest
gaze and trembling limbs betrayed her emotion. “But what is
lengthened time to me? Listen to the tale of one whose life has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
been a long, long day of misery. Thessaly was the land of my
birth; my infancy was bright as the dreams of the morning; but
the destroyer came; the Romans, like the ravening wolves, poured
upon our plains; my father fell, defending the home of my childhood,
and my mother, with the wretched being, before you, was
enslaved by the conquerors. Borne down by misery, she sank beneath
the weight, and, while exposed in your market place, for
sale to the highest bidder, I saw my last friend expire, and, the
unfeeling crowd estimated the loss to the owner. I stood alone
amid the multitude, my heart swelled in agony, but hate for the
oppressor, and desire of revenge prevailed over all; I clasped my
throat, that I, too, might die and disappoint, still more, our brutal
enslaver, but, as I tightened my hold, and all things grew dim
around me, a hand grasped my arm and a voice of compassion
saluted my ear. After a few words with my master, I became
the property of Marcus Curtius; he pitied my distress; he caused
the remains of my mother to be interred, and, each day, her child
was permitted to deck her grave with flowers. I was reared with
kindness, but, to, all, save my protector and his immediate family,
my heart was bitter with hatred. In the dreams of my disturbed
slumbers, the home of my happiness would appear before
me, its fertile fields, its rich groves of olives and figs, the vine-covered
porch, the sweet songs of my country; then the scene of
my father’s death, my mother’s dying glance, and I awoke in
agony and despair; revenge in any form was the only object of
my thought. This passion I nurtured, and when civil wars
drenched the country in blood, when the family of my protector
was dispersed, opportunities of gratifying it were daily presented.
I did not embrue my hands in blood, but my heart exulted in the
woes of the enslavers of my country; I did not take life, but I
did not save it, when it was in my power. Years rolled on; I
had no home, for I abhorred the haunts of mankind. The mountain
cave was my shelter, the wild fruits of the mountain my food;
but, almost unknown to myself one tie was yet unsevered. The
mild glance of pity, bestowed upon me, when helpless and alone
in the world, was never forgotten, and the occasional kind word,
and look of sympathy had sank deep into my heart. I still cherished
a kindly remembrance of the house of him who had saved
me, perhaps, from a worse fate than death. In my wanderings I
encountered a being as wretched as myself; she taught me to
gratify my ruling passion by attempting to dive into futurity, to
render the life of man more wretched, by foretelling the events
which are to come. In the depths of the forest, in the recesses of
the mountain would we invoke the power of fiends, with the malice
of demons would we prepare spells to impose upon the credulity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
of the ignorant, and, with horrid glee, aggravate the grief of
mankind, of the wretched. Is there hope,” said she, rising, “for
such as I am, with the God of purity and love whom you worship?”
“Even so,” was the mild and soothing response of Sister
Helena. “He has been leading you by a way which you knew not.
He has been removing all your stays, that you may be stayed only
upon Him; your father, country, mother, the protectors of your
youth, every joy and comfort, and now, at the close of a long life,
He calls you to Himself. Though the sins be as crimson, they
shall be white as wool.” The Sybil bent her head; the sweet hope
of mercy softened her heart; all was quiet around, among the
aged trees, whose branches shaded the venerable mansion, a
nightingale had chosen her seat, and, at intervals, poured forth
her soft melody. During the silence, solemn music arose from
the apartments within, and a chorus of voices sang the following
hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mourn not for him, whose lengthened years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have closed in holy peace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His home is now where neither tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor sorrows find a place.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like as the sun, in glory bright</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sank ’neath the glowing sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rise again, with morning light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And greet us in the sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So bright, so peaceful, closed his day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So glorious will he rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jesus has pointed him the way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bliss beyond the skies.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sounds died away, and when the aged woman raised her
head, her moistened eyes expressed her emotion. “To find objects,”
she continued, “on whom to wreak any vengeance I again
sought the abodes of man; my predictions were heard with awe
and terror; many a young heart, throbbing with hope and visions
of bliss, have I caused to beat with dreaded anticipations of evil,
and blasted many a dream of happiness. My unhallowed occupation
was attended with danger, and, at one time my life was in
jeopardy. I was threatened with torture and death, and, publicly
exposed, was upon the point of meeting a deserved doom,
when Nero, passing the spot, caused inquiries to be made as to the
cause of the tumult. His was a heart exulting in all the evil
passions of human nature, and the being at enmity with all the
world might claim kindred sympathy with him. He ordered my
release, and, when with sullen disdain, I denounced him, and foretold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
his crimes, he jeeringly said I should be under his protection,
and forbade any interference with my vocation. But, amidst
all my misery and crime, I did not forget the family which had
shown me kindness. I followed their career in weal or woe; their
enemies were doubly mine. Wandering in search of food, at one
time a fierce wolf sprang from his lurking place, and an instant
more would have ended my guilty life, but an unerring arrow,
from an unseen hand, struck his heart, and he lay dead at my
feet. A young Roman emerged from the thicket, and my eye immediately
recognized, in his noble countenance, one of the only
race whose features raised a kindly feeling in my breast. He
gazed upon my haggard form with wonder. “Give God glory,”
said he, “He has saved you from a dreadful death.” “My life
is a burden,” was my sullen answer, “I give thanks to no being.
I own no God, and man is my deadly enemy.” Again I saw the
same pitying expression of countenance, which had saved me
when a child. “If,” said he, “man has injured you, God is your
avenger; if you have injured him, God is your judge, and if you
are wretched, God will be your comforter.” It was the son of
your love; for whose blood the tyrant thirsted, who saved me from
the savage beast; whose words first caused a ray of hope to enter
this dark heart.” “And must this son, perish?” said the mother,
in the piercing accents of grief, “must I never again see him? and
my Cleone,” and anguish checked her utterance. “The hours of
the life of his persecutor are numbered,” said the Sybil, “and not
by my vain art do I know this. The city is even now in commotion;
the Senate have decreed his death; hear ye not those sounds
of wild uproar? Hear ye not the shouts of the soldiers?” They
listened with intense attention, and the distant cries of “Death to
the tyrant” were plainly distinguishable amidst the hoarse clamor
of the mob; and occupied by the most anxious suspense, it was
some moments ere the matron observed the sinking form of the
recluse and her deathly paleness. She was prevented from summoning
assistance by her sudden arousing to exertion. “His
death, mother?” said she, “didst thou say his death? Will they
not leave him the possibility of repentance? Would I might see
him, even now!” “To what purpose,” said the aged Sybil, “his
heart is as the flinty rock upon which the wild waves of the ocean
have beaten for ages. Thy life might be the forfeit.” “Mother!
the smile and word of kindly sympathy sank deep; never to be
eradicated from thy remembrance; Nero! this tyrant of Rome;
this monster so detested by humanity, was kind to her, who now
would sacrifice life so she might kindle a spark of hope in his benighted
soul.” The sounds from the now fully aroused multitudes
of Rome were increasing to deafening outcries, and the attendants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
surrounded their mistress. “There are footsteps approaching,”
said one, and, issuing from the shaded pathway,
Cleone and the faithful domestic, who had, with Lucius Flavius,
accompanied her to the palace, stood before them. The heartfelt
thanksgiving of her mother, as she clasped her in a close embrace,
the joyous welcome of the domestics, the tears of gratitude,
which stood upon the cheeks of the recluse, seemed even to awake
sympathy in the stern heart of the Sybil. “But your brother, my
Cleone?” “He will be saved, my own dear mother. Nero has
commanded his release, and he will soon be restored to us.” The
simultaneous burst of triumph around, showed the affection
borne to their noble young master, and words would fail to express
the joy and thankfulness which pervaded the breast of the
pious mother. “I leave you for a space, dear friends,” said
Helena, “I leave you, rejoicing in the grace of God, and if we
meet no more on earth, let me greet you in a happier home above.
There,” said she, raising her beautiful eyes to heaven, “there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor sighing.” “And thou
art going?” said the Sybil. “To perform my duty,” said she,
and disappeared in the thicket.</p>

<p>At this time the principle streets of Rome presented a spectacle
of intense interest. A legion of the army, bearing
the Imperial Eagle, the long tufts of their helmets waving in
the breeze, preceded a car, guarded by cavalry, whose burnished
armor reflected every ray of light, in which was seated Servius
Galba, the newly elected Emperor of Rome. At intervals the
brazen trumpets poured forth their triumphant notes, the deafening
shouts of thousands swelled upon the air, and mingled cries
of victory and execration burst from the countless multitude. As
the imposing procession approached the palace of Nero, the tumult
increased, the rumor spread that its detested master had
fled, and the terrible cry of “death” resounded on every side.
The brilliant illumination of the splendid building had faded into
gloom, the music had ceased, and its inhabitants had dispersed in
terror. Such are the vicissitudes of greatness. The despotic
Emperor, whose mandates, but a few hours before, were obeyed
with servile fear, to whose debasing pleasures the riches of the
world were subservient, and for the gratification of whose malice
thousands had expired in agonizing tortures, was now a despised
fugitive, a proscribed criminal, proscribed alike by the laws, as
well as the justice of his injured country. Amidst this tumult,
with hearts throbbing with praise and thanksgiving to God, the
young Christians, after Curtius had been so unexpectedly released
from his prison, parted for a short time; Curtius to make
glad the hearts nearest and dearest to him by his return home, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Flavius to fulfil his engagement with Nero, to intercede with the
new Emperor for the life of the miserable and despicable tyrant.</p>

<p>Avoiding the excited populace, two persons had, by the most
obscure passages, approached the Imperial Palace; the one an
aged man, wrapped in a dark tunic and supporting his steps by a
staff, the other a female, closely enveloped and cautiously shielded
from observation. As they drew near the colossal entrance their
course was arrested by a sentry and, on requiring admittance to
the presence of Nero, they were answered by derision.</p>

<p>“Admittance for a grey cowl! by my faith, no; but for this
gear,” said he, “I will warrant a passage, though shaded by a
hood and enshrouded in a frieze mantle.”</p>

<p>“Peace, rude brawler,” said the aged man, “attend to thy vocation.”</p>

<p>“My vocation now,” said the fierce soldier, “is to silence such
greybeards as thou,” but, as he raised his truncheon, the female,
raising her hood, and stepping before her companion, said:</p>

<p>“Wouldst thou harm one to whom the Father of all things has
allotted so long a term of life? Suffer us to pass to the presence
of Nero and accept the thanks of one who has no other guerdon
to bestow.”</p>

<p>Struck by the transcendent beauty of the suppliant and awed by
her manner, he lowered his weapon, but still refused admittance
to her companion.</p>

<p>“If his tongue wag not too freely,” said he, “yonder bench
may afford him a resting place; for thee, fair one, if it chooseth
thee, thou mayst try thy fortune within, but, by the powers of
Erebus, I warn you not to pursue the venture. Dost thou hear
the commotion and uproar of the city? and the near approach of
the tumult? Within the palace there is confusion: the lights are
extinguished and, methinks, there is danger in the wind. Best
retrace thy way, pretty one, with thy crusty fellow-traveler; his
journey of life is too nearly ended to be an able protector for
thee.”</p>

<p>“If there is danger, friend, why dost thou stay to encounter it?”</p>

<p>“I am a Roman soldier,” said he, proudly; “my post is here and,
come what may, I shall retain it.”</p>

<p>“I, too, soldier, have my post of duty; for thee, father, I pray
thee return by the unfrequented path we traced on our way
hither.”</p>

<p>“I leave thee not, my daughter,” said the old man, “but will rest
my wearied limbs a brief period; in the meantime, may the Lord
bless thy purpose!”</p>

<p>“Amen, holy father,” said the recluse, for with the hope that
at this moment of terror the stubborn heart of Nero might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
led to contrition, she, who had once been as the day-star of his
life, had now sought his presence, fearless of her own risk, in
confronting his revengeful rage.</p>

<p>A slave guided her steps through the lofty halls, whose arched
ceilings glittered with representations of the starry firmament,
while showers of sweet fragrance filled the air with odors. Ere
they had passed far they encountered many slaves who, with
hurried steps, were hastening to the entrance.</p>

<p>“How go matters now, Curio?” said the guide.</p>

<p>“Lacca has returned,” said the one addressed. “The Legions
are in motion; Servius Galba is proclaimed Emperor and Nero
has fled. Save thyself, Arrius, hearest thou not the approach of
the insurgents?”</p>

<p>“Nero fled!” said the startled guide. “A truce to thine errand,
then, fair lady. Thou art too late.”</p>

<p>“Too late indeed,” she said, clasping her hands in anguish.
“Yet, stay, friend.” It was vain, for the alarmed servitor had followed
his fellow slaves; and uncertain and distressed, she stood
irresolute, which way to shape her course. At this moment the
Sybil stood before her.</p>

<p>“Said I not his hour of mercy had passed?” said she. “A night
of hopeless gloom has closed around him, and clouds envelope
the sweet star of mercy. Said I not so?”</p>

<p>“Hope is not lost, mother,” said the recluse. “Shall we limit
the power of the Omnipotent? There is yet hope, even for Nero.”
The roar of inflamed and furious thousands now broke upon their
ears. The Palatine hill was surrounded and, with speed unparalleled
in one so aged, the Sybil drew her companion along a
narrow entrance to a secluded path which led through the magnificent
gardens of the palace, now deserted by all save straggling
bands of fugitives. “Stay, mother,” said the recluse, “Father
Paulo is left behind. He awaits us near yon column.” As
they drew near the aged priest rose from his reclining posture.
“Blessings on His Name, daughter, for that he hath returned
thee in safety. Let no harrowing fears perplex thee for him
whom thou hast sought to save; he hath sown the wind and he
must reap the whirlwind. “His Holy Name be blessed,” said the
recluse; and, in silence, they passed on their way. The soft plashing
of the fountains, whose lucid drops sparkled in the moonbeams,
the dewy freshness of the lawns, and the gentle breathing
of the night air contrasted with the wild fury behind them and
the storm of unbridled vengeance which now encompassed the
palace and shook even its foundation, soothed the perturbed spirit
and hushed each murmuring passion to peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Herbert closed the book. “It must be deeply interesting,” said
he, “to visit this ancient city. Its scenes are so intimately connected
with events of history which are familiar to us from
childhood, and so many of its features must remain unaltered.
The ancient tombs are still there, the same old pavements are frequently
unearthed which were trod by those heroes whose names
are familiar to us as ‘household words,’ and whose stones have
been swept by the royal purple. The Tiber will still pursue its
winding course, and the lofty Apennines still bound the prospect,
although time demolishes its mighty works of art.” “Was not
Virgil born under the Roman government, Herbert?” said
Charles. “He was, and highly favored by Augustus Caesar, the
most powerful monarch of Rome.” “Do you think there were
such delightful rural scenes in those times as he describes in
his Pastorals?” said Susan. “In the earlier days of Rome,” said
Herbert, “before luxury and its attendant vices had enervated
and destroyed the energies of the country, the employments of
the husbandman and shepherd formed the principal occupations
of the people; to excel in agriculture was to acquire a title to
public respect, and some of their most powerful dictators and
bravest commanders were ‘taken from the plough.’ At the time
to which our story refers, husbandry was regarded with less
respect than in former times. The cultivation of the fields was
often committed to the care of slaves; the introduction of foreign
luxuries had paved the way for crime in all its forms, and from
that time the progress of the nation was downward. The pleasant
scenes of country life, described by Virgil, were probably
drawn from nature, embellished, perhaps, with a poet’s license.”
“But the beauty of these Arcadian scenes,” said Mrs. Wilson,
“is associated in our minds with the idea of innocence and
virtue; we believe they were happy, surrounded by these scenes
of rural beauty, because they were good.” “True,” said Herbert,
“let us but imagine their delightful groves, their breezy
hills and green pastures to be the resorts of vice and crime, the
charm is broken at once; we no longer dream of the beauty of
the ‘spreading beech,’ the rich taste of the ‘golden apples,’ or the
sweet murmuring of the ‘mossy fountains’; instead of the bright
sunshine of peace and happiness, the gloomy clouds of sin and
misery would disfigure every beauty.” “Such is the effect of
virtue,” said his mother, “every charm is heightened by its presence,
and every beauty destroyed by its absence.” “How pleasant,”
said Susan, “to read Virgil’s description of a northern winter,
over a bright fire!” “The pleasures of his winter evenings,
however,” said Mary, “were confined to frolic and play, and their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
refreshments to ‘acid cider and beer’; how different from our
evenings, where there are ‘fireside enjoyments, home-born happiness.’”
“Yes,” said Elizabeth, “and, to continue your quotation:</p>

<p>Circumstances intervened to prevent the continuation of the

Herbert read a sacred poem upon the subject of Christ’s restoring

<p>“How deserted are now those scenes of such great and mighty
interest! Jericho, once the stronghold of the ancient Canaanites,
then a populous and probably magnificent city of the Jews, is now
a small and mean village, the abode of a few Arabs, and its once
beautiful plains, through which flows the sacred river of Jordan,
are almost as dead and inanimate as the waters of the sea in its
vicinity, where the proud and guilty cities of former days were
buried. “Sin, in its varied forms,” said Mrs. Wilson, has brought
this desolation on this chosen land, this land, more blessed and
favored than all others, not only in its natural advantages, but
as the land which God had selected to display His omnipotent
power, and where the Savior of the world passed the short but
eventful years of his life upon earth. Let our prayers, my children,
ascend to the Giver of all good, that He will check, in our
hearts, ever, the slightest indication to evil, for the consequences
are always misery.” “What a misfortune, to be blind,”
said Susan. “I can scarcely imagine a more desolate condition
than that of a person totally blind.” “It is not always so,” returned
Elizabeth, “I have heard it said that blind people were frequently
more contented, more uniformly placid in their dispositions
than many who can see. Is it so, mother?” “I knew a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
blind man,” said Mrs. Wilson, “the whole tenor of whose life
would justify us in that belief. He was always quiet and calm,
of a pleasant countenance, and there was an habitual smile about
his mouth which would seem to express the sunshine of his heart.
He would sometimes ramble about, without any guide but his
cane, feeling his way by the walls and fences, but never attempting
to leave these way-marks without some helping hand,
frequently claiming the assistance of the children of the village,
which was never refused. His home was a happy one, consisting
of his aged father, his brother, and a relative of the family, who
acted as housekeeper, but was, in reality, considered as daughter
and sister, and whose kindly heart led her to make the life of
poor Joseph as happy as it was possible to render it. In his
solitude, when confined to the house by the inclemency of the
weather, he would dictate verses for some one to write, and,
however they might be wanting in smoothness, or correct diction,
although even the sense might be doubtful, yet there was
a strain of piety and reliance on God which showed a heart resigned
to His will. The peaceful grave has closed over him and
his death was calm and gentle as his life. And now, with grateful
thanks to God for all his goodness, we will retire to rest.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The day was clear and bright, the sky without a cloud, and the
pure white snow covered with a glittering crust, which did not
fail beneath the weight when Herbert proposed a short walk, to
which the younger part of the little community readily assented.
The air was keen and bracing, but they were well defended from
it, and the sunbeams were warm and pleasant. Charles was full
of life and glee, and bounding forward was ready to point to any
object which he thought worthy of notice. “And do you know,
Susan,” said he, “Uncle Bill says the worst of the winter weather
is over, and that there are many signs that we shall have an early
spring?” “I am in no hurry to have the winter pass away,” replied
Susan, “and am in a good mind to be sorry for the signs of
spring, but, Herbert, you have not yet given us any clue to the
history of Uncle Bill, and if you will but remember, you promised
it, menacing me, at the same time, with some terrible illustration
of female caprice.” “You shall hear it, my dear Susan, and remember
though it may have been the subject of some sport to us,
the consequences have been almost death to him. His youth was
prosperous and happy; though not possessed of brilliant talents,
his powers of mind were good, and he united to them an activity
and enterprise which soon placed him in a situation of trust and
profit, in the city of Philadelphia. His relations were all of the
Society of Friends; he was patronized and esteemed by the members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
of that wealthy and respectable sect in that city, and, by his
intercourse with refined society, both in England and America,
for the business in which he was engaged required frequent voyages
across the Atlantic, his manners became polished, which,
added to his naturally graceful and unaffected demeanor, rendered
him an universal favorite. He became attached and offered
himself to a beautiful girl, a daughter of one of the wealthy
and influential citizens of the place; with the sanction of her
friends, his suit was encouraged; and, as much happiness as this
world can give dawned upon his prospects. His bright hope of
bliss was overclouded, for, after a year of assiduous affection
on his part, and apparent kindness and complacency upon her
own, a change came over the ‘dream of his hope,’ and, without
assigning any reason for her inconstancy or fickleness, she no
longer received his attentions with pleasure, and with cruel indifference
to his feelings, required their discontinuance. Thunderstruck
at this blow to his dearest hopes, he attempted to avert
it, but her cold adherence to her determination, and the bitter
scorn with which she treated his remonstrances, convinced him
that she had never possessed any true affection for him. Quick
and sensitive as he was he felt in every pore her unkind treatment,
it undermined his health, destroyed the energy of his mind
and, when he found, some months afterward, that her marriage
with another was to be celebrated, the total overthrow of every
hope completed the prostration of his mind and body. A severe
illness followed; after a long period, his naturally good constitution
triumphed, and he regained health, but the vigor and activity
of his mental faculties were gone forever. He returned to his
business, but, wholly unfitted for the necessary application to its
duties, he allowed himself to fall into habits of carelessness and
inattention, which resulted in a heavy pecuniary loss to the establishment
with which he was connected. Mortification and the
fear of disgrace were now added to the feelings of wretchedness
which oppressed him, and he sought relief in dissipation. This
was the climax of his fate; from that time he sank lower and
lower, though, struggling with his ruin, he would, at times, forswear
the intoxicating wine cup, and the debasing gaming house,
yet, the energy of his character, never firm, was lost. His connections
in business were dissolved, and his friends, to save the remnant
of his fortune, removed him from the scene, alike of his happiness
and misery, and brought him back to his early home. Still,
all efforts to restore his mind were vain, and, though in time,
he lost some sense of his unhappiness and blasted hopes, he was
but the wreck of his former self. He wanders about like a child,
amusing himself with childish pleasures; attaching himself warmly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
to those who are kind and gentle to him, but feeling, with the
most distressing sensibility, any imaginary slight. This, then,
Susan, is the melancholy history of ‘Uncle Bill,’ as he is now universally
called.” “Oh! I shall never laugh again, when I see
him; poor, poor, Uncle Bill.” “But what,” said Mary, “was the
fate of the thoughtless wicked girl, who was the cause of this
ruin?” “I know nothing of her after life, but that it was not
long.” “I think,” said Elizabeth, “that he must have possessed a
weak intellect, or it would not have yielded so easily to such base
treatment. I think, Herbert, that indignation would have triumphed
in your heart, over every other emotion.” “I do not
know, my sister, but I most sincerely hope that I may never bestow
an affection of my heart upon so heartless a being.” With
an unanimous assent to this hope, they now bent their steps home.</p>

<p>Meeting again at evening, and each being engaged in some useful
avocation, Herbert continued their course of reading the tale
of the early Christians.</p>

<p>With a hasty step Lucius Flavius pursued his way through the
streets of the city, thronged with persons of every rank and degree,
on whose countenances might be traced emotions of every
different kind. In some, the wondering stare of idle curiosity
mingled with the vacant look of indifference as to what events
were transpiring; in others, the animated glance of triumphant
success, with the look and gesture of determined vengeance. Here
stood a group whose debauched features and downcast expression
proclaimed that they were companions of the infamous pleasures
of Nero, and that in his downfall they lamented the loss of
a protecting patron, and there, a crowd, who having been deeply
injured by the tyrant, were venting their impotent rage by mutilating
his statues, and tearing down the garlands which had
decorated them. The name of Nero, repeated, was coupled with
the deepest execrations, but Flavius stopped not to inquire his
fate. Forcing his way through the dense multitude, which surrounded
the palace of Servius Galba, he required of a guard to be
admitted to his presence, and while awaiting the return of his
messenger contemplated, with interest, the scene before him. The
brilliant illumination of the building cast a broad light upon the
adjacent objects, and a radiant reflection was thrown back from
the glittering armor of the long lines of soldiers. The roar of the
rapidly increasing crowd sounded from afar like the tempestuous
waves of the ocean, while the strict discipline of the army prevented
any demonstrations of disorder immediately around the
palace. Amidst the distant uproar, the name of Galba was reiterated
with joyful acclamations, mingled with deep and terrible
denunciations of death for the tyrant. Such, thought the young
Roman, is the mutability of greatness; but his reflections were interrupted
by a favorable answer to his request for admittance, and
he followed an attendant to the presence of the Emperor. Surrounded
by some of the most powerful and influential citizens of
Rome, with the flush of successful ambition upon his brow, and a
proud joy flashing from his eyes, stood Servius Galba, arrayed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
the imperial purple, and a crown of laurel upon his head. Advancing
a few steps to meet and receive the congratulatory homage
of the young noble, he said, with an exulting smile, “The
Fates have been propitious, my lord Flavius, the reign of despotism
and disgrace is at an end; the Senate have confirmed the election
of the Army, and we will commence our reign by an act of
clemency towards that obnoxious sect, who are turning the world
upside down by their heresys. It might perhaps be policy,” said
he, addressing those who were near, “to extend mercy to some of
these offenders, we find, after long experience in these matters,
that opposition but increases their obstinacy.” “The young Roman,
Quintius Curtius, is already liberated, noble Galba,” said
Flavius, “and I now appear to offer my service to return you most
hearty thanks for your intercession, and to perform a condition,
upon the fulfilment of which the miserable tyrant insisted ere he
granted the life of my friend.” “Aye,” said Galba, “he released
him, then; he treated my intercession with insolent contumely, and
by his arrogant menaces hastened the consummation of the events
to which I alluded in our last interview. Perhaps it is best so;
but, my friend, caution this young fanatic; he has talents and
noble abilities, if rightly applied, and if he will not, by his imprudent
enthusiasm, thwart my measures, for your sake, I will see to
his advancement.” This was said in a lower tone, then aloud.
“But this condition which has been imposed by the imperious homicide;
what is its purport?” “Merely, noble Emperor, that I
should intercede with you that his life might be spared, which petition
I now humbly lay before you, representing that his power
is now impotent, that mercy is the attribute of heaven, and that,
imitating this attribute, when power is given us so to do, we may
the more boldly claim it in our hour of need.” “You say well,
noble Flavius, but this matter is beyond my control. The Senate
have decreed the punishment, which, severe and harsh as it may
seem, is so richly his due. He is sentenced to be dragged through
the streets he has degraded by his infamous excesses, and disgraced
by his outrageous cruelties, scourged, and then thrown
from the Tarpeian Rock. I have, however,” said he, addressing
Flavius in a confidential tone, “caused my freedman to follow and
warn him of this decree, and he may yet escape its horrors by a
voluntary death.” “A most dreadful alternative,” said Flavius,
“but, may he not yet elude it? He is not destitute of partisans.”
“It is not possible,” said the Emperor, “the avenues are guarded,
he has been traced to his villa, and escape is impracticable. This
has been an eventful night, my countrymen, may the dawn see
Rome fully emancipated from her disgraceful thraldom. For the
present, Lucius Flavius, farewell, preparations must be made for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the ceremonies of the day; you shall be instructed as to our future
proceedings.”</p>

<p>The first faint appearance of the dawn of day was seen, the
fleecy clouds were dispersing before the gradual approach of light,
and the thin mist arose around the tops of the mountains, when,
at the entrance of a rugged ravine, skirted by the highroad, stood
a man partially concealed by a clump of trees, apparently watching
for the appearance of some one. He was pale and haggard,
and, at every distant noise would cower into his retreat, and listen
with the most intense eagerness. The sweet sounds of the morning
had commenced in the soft twitterings of the birds over his
head, and its breezy breath played upon his parched lips and feverish
brow, but without bestowing serenity to his spirit, or affording
refreshment to his wearied frame. His impatience seemed to
increase as the shades of night gave way before the rosy hues
that betokened the approach of day, and as those tokens rapidly
increased, as the tops of the mountains, and the distant spires of
the city caught the first gleam of the rising sun, as the far off
horn of the shepherd was heard collecting his flock for their rich
pasture, it almost amounted to agony. It was Anicetus, the freedman,
the wretched agent of his wretched master, who, flying
from fear of the vengeance due to his crimes, here awaited the
coming of one, who, formerly his fellow servant, he believed
would not betray him, and, from whom he might learn, with certainty,
the state of the public mind. What, to him, was the smiling
face of nature or the bright beams of the sun? Midnight
gloom and lowering tempest would have been more congenial to
his guilty soul. As he stood motionless, his heavy eyes cast upon
the ground, and his knit brow shaded in gloom, a squirrel sprang
from the covert upon a decayed branch directly before him, as the
sprightly animal stood, with his fearless innocent eyes, glancing
around, the miserable man gnashed his teeth, and in the impotence
of his rage that any living thing should be happy, aimed a
blow, which the active animal eluded, the next instant standing
upon the topmost bough of a lofty tree, chattering in his joyous
glee. The thought of happiness was hateful to him, as he remembered
the scene he had just left, and the imminent danger of his
own situation. He had seen the master whom, from his earliest
childhood he had instructed in evil, to whose base and wicked passions
he had ever been subservient, but, to whom, if his corrupt
heart ever felt the sensation of affection, he was more attached
than to any living thing, breathe out his guilty soul in all the horrors
of despair; had seen him dreading the approach of death, and
evading its final grasp by every futile expedient. He had assisted
in gathering a funeral pile in that garden, where so much luxury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
had reigned, and which had so often been the resort of crime and
pollution; he had prepared the deadly draught at the command of
the abject Emperor, and had seen him reject it in horror. He had
joined in chanting a dirge for the dead; a dirge for the master, in
whose veins at that moment the current of life was warm and
glowing and, with trembling hand had opened those veins, that
life might pass away with the red stream; then, with hurried
alarm, arrested its flow by strong bandages, as the ghastly and
shuddering tyrant, shrinking from the abyss over which his
wretched soul was hovering, asserted that his time had not yet
come. To close the frightful scene, he, in the last moment, held
the glittering weapon, while Nero, the tyrant of his country, the
bitter and untiring persecutor of the unoffending Christians,
rushed upon its point, and closed that life, which had been a
curse to the world; and now, he found himself alone, exposed to
a just and terrible retribution, which awaited his own crimes, and
his connivance at those of another. But now, the tramp of a horse
became distinctly audible, and a rider, wearing the livery of Servius
Galba, appeared, in rapid motion, for the city. As he approached
the thicket its occupant moved forward, evidently wishing
to be seen. “Ha!” said the horseman, stopping, “you here,
Anicetus, like a wolf in his lair? By Jupiter, old acquaintance, it
would have been well to have lived, so that you need not fear to be
seen.” “No more of that,” said the freedman, in a sullen tone,
“did you perform the service I requested?” “We laid the body
upon the pile you had collected, and, kindling the flame, the thick
smoke arose in the morning air, grim and black as the pit of
Erebus.” “That is a good deed done, comrade; I owe you much;
his body is then beyond their reach, ’twas his last request; I can
trust you, old friend, what is my safest course?” “Leave Rome
behind you; track your way through the most unfrequented paths
to some distant land, and, in quitting your country, leave all your
sins and ill-gotten treasures, that you may travel light. You will
not be safe here an hour, the scent is up, and the hunters will not
flag.” “Say you so, then farewell to Rome; thanks to the gods,
there are other skies, the air of this place seems damp and unwholesome.”
“The atmosphere is clearing, friend, it will work
itself pure shortly. Farewell. Fear not that I shall betray you.
May the gods prompt you to lead a better life, and provide you a
better master.” He pursued his way to the city, and the dark and
guilty man, plunging into the ravine, was lost to sight.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“The environs of Rome,” said Herbert, “once so delightful,
are now but a dreary waste, with no human habitation or fertile
fields; the melancholy ruins of former greatness, scattered here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
and there, but add to the desolation and the poisonous exhalations
from stagnant marshes have driven almost all life from its
desert soil.” “Why should this air be so infectious?” said Mary;
“it surely was not so in former times, for, had it been, the Roman
territories would not have been so populous.” “The lands around
the city in the bright days of Rome,” said Herbert, “were highly
cultivated; they were drained of their superabundant moisture,
trees were planted and rich vineyards cherished; the whole extent
of territory around the great emporium was like a garden,
supplying the wants of the immense population; the inhabitants
lived under their own vines and fig trees, and had every inducement
to industry, and every encouragement to render their
soil as fertile as possible, and peace and prosperity was the consequence.
But, when powerful, barbarous nations, allured by
the riches and splendor of Rome, and probably foreseeing that
her inhabitants, enervated by luxury and long-continued prosperity,
would become an easy prey to their rapacity, poured upon
the rich and beautiful plains of Italy, devastation and ruin marked
their course. The fruitful trees were cut down, the vineyards
defaced, the drains and aqueducts destroyed, the inhabitants
slain, or, saving themselves by flight, and their pleasant dwellings
leveled with the ground. Disheartened and discouraged, the
Roman people no longer possessed the energy to combat with
their fate. They forsook their ruined plains and the noxious vapors
arising from the deserted fields, producing disease and pestilence,
gave up all thought of repairing the ravages of war. The mischief
has been gradually increasing and threatens, at some future
day, to make the “Eternal City,” as it has been named, like
Babylon of old, the residence of only noisome reptiles.” “It is
sad,” said his mother, “to reflect upon the fate of these mighty
nations, and to know that their downfall was the consequence
of their crimes. May luxury, with its long train of evils, be far
from our own native land!” “Shall I interpret your looks,
Susan?” remarked Herbert, smiling; “you are thinking that,
though luxury may be a great evil, you would rather prefer a
little of it; that you should not exactly like the frugal meals of
the old Romans, ‘a radish and an egg, under an oak.’” “You are
partly right, Herbert,” said she, “notwithstanding their simplicity,
patriotism and bravery, and all that sort of things, there is
something revolting in some of their manners and customs; witness
the little ceremony used in procuring their wives in those
early days.” “That was when Rome was first founded, Susan,”
said Charles. “Those were not what Herbert calls the bright
days of Rome.” “True, true, my little critic,” said Herbert:
“simplicity, in the days referred to by Susan, was barbarism, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
patriotism and bravery then were often questionable virtues.”
“Were there any such really brave and good men, at those times,
as Gen. George Washington?” said Charles. “Their greatest
and best men,” said Mrs. Wilson, “had not that light to guide
them which he possessed. The paths, to him like noonday, were
to them enveloped in shadowy gloom; but in no age has there ever
lived a man who more truly deserved to be ‘first in the hearts
of his countrymen’ than Washington, the pride and boast of
America. His firm and steady prudence, his sound discretion
and unwavering integrity, his noble courage, and, above all, his
unswerving trust in Providence, render him the model of all
greatness. Other conquerors sought their own aggrandizement;
he, only that of his country; they trampled on all laws, human
and divine, to attain their purposes; his great aim and object was
the happiness of the world as well as that of his beloved country.”
“The death of Washington,” said Herbert, “proved the estimation
in which he was held by the nation. They knew not, until then,
how much they had relied upon his penetrating judgment and
firm perseverance, his incorruptible integrity and unshaken
patriotism; that star was removed whose steady ray had uniformly
pointed to the path of true glory and a mist seemed for
a time to envelope the world. The most enthusiastic honors
were paid to his memory; his loss was deplored from one extremity
of the country to the other; even prattling babes were
clothed in the symbols of mourning and, had this great and good
man lived in the days of heathen Rome, he would have been
deified and honored as a god. Orators, in eloquent language,
poured forth his praises and poets chose their noblest strains
for his honor: malice and envy found no place for their innuendos
and the smoothing hand of time was not needed to fix his glorious
character.”</p>

<p>The next leisure evening was devoted to the conclusion of the
Roman Tale.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The day of freedom from oppression dawned upon Rome.
The short period of repose had renewed the excitement and
activity of the populace, who, aroused by tidings of the fate of
Nero, and enraged that he had escaped their vengeance, wreaked
it upon every object marked by the favor of the tyrant Emperor.
Nothing but the strictest orders, enforced by a powerful
guard of soldiers, preserved the splendid palace, “The Golden
House,” the rich abode of the luxurious Nero, from destruction,
but his statues, and those which he had caused to be erected in
honor of his chosen favorites, were demolished with the most
bitter imprecations. Again the shouts of triumph and rejoicing
would peal through the air and with the wildest enthusiasm the
people assumed the peculiar cap worn by the slaves upon their
restoration to freedom, as a token that they, too, were freed
from bondage. Garlands of laurel adorned the streets, were
twined around the colonnades of the buildings, and hung in festoons
from the projecting balconies, and, as the triumphal chariot
of the new Emperor, surrounded by the imposing array of military
pomp, passed slowly through the crowded ways, toward the
Capitol, to attend the ceremonies of the day, showers of roses
descended upon him and music hailed his progress. Paeans arose
from the temples and the odor of incense made the air fragrant.
The Amphitheatre, destined that day to have been the scene of
torture and death, was left in silence and solitude, a general jubilee
was proclaimed, prisoners were released, and all executions
were suspended.</p>

<p>Beneath a low-browed arch sat the Thessalian Sybil; her form
was more attenuated, the excitement and fatigue of the night
had worn upon her aged frame, but her still keen eyes watched
the motions of the crowd and her lips were moving with suppressed
thought. A citizen, whose lameness precluded his attendance
upon the procession, was gazing upon her as he leaned upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
his crutches. “Mother,” said he, “the Destinies have suffered
your thread of life to stretch far.” She raised her eyes to his
face. “Didst thou mark the gay pageant, citizen of Rome?”
“Aye, did I; by my troth,” was the answer, “it was a goodly
sight.” “It has passed before me as a shadow,” she said, “as
the mist of the morning, indistinct and fading. It is a few days
since these eyes beheld the murdered body of your great Caesar
born through these streets, in mournful array: since these ears
heard the din of civil war through these lands, when brother
fought against brother, and father against son; heard the exultant
shouts proclaiming the mighty Augustus Emperor of Rome, and
saw the massy gates of Janus closed, as the signal of peace upon
earth. I have heard rejoicing and triumph echo through this city
at the commencement of a reign, and still louder rejoicing at its
close. I have seen a stately temple arise, dedicated to thy gods,
the incense streaming from its altars, mingling with that of one
consecrated to Caligula; but a few years rolled on and he met
his death from the parasites who aided in the blasphemy. The
wind which now breathes softly around us, and which, a few
short hours having passed, may sweep the plains in its fury, is
not more variable than this fickle populace. Again and again exulting
shouts and bitter curses follow each other in quick succession
and will do so till the glory of this proud city is shrouded
in the dust.” She had uttered these words in a low, but deep
and earnest tone; her head rested upon her hands and her elbows
upon her knees; the soliloquy she had commenced to the person
who had stood near her seemed to have been, in part, the utterance
of the recollections of her life, without reference to any
listener. Another citizen passing, “Thou are weatherbound,
Rutilius,” addressing the lame man, “the gods console thee; thou
hast lost a glorious spectacle.” “May the Furies seize the unwieldy
Goth who crippled my limbs!” was the answer. “Describe
the show, Curio.” “Thou shouldst have seen the noble Emperor
Galba; with what a gracious dignity he accepted the homage of
the Senate, and the oaths of the soldiery, and heard his oration to
the people; how he thanked them for their suffrages; and how
the priests in their solemn array offering sacrifices, as the smoke
of the incense arose in clouds before them, sang paeans to the
deities, and the pealing notes reverberated around the lofty
ceiling. In good truth, friend, thy limbs have proved recreant
in this matter.” “Rome will thrive under the reign of this
Galba,” said Rutilius. “There will be something going on beside
these dismal executions, of which we may well be weary.” “More,
by token,” said the other, when every day renewed them. By the
powers above! it joys my heart that the noble Curtius has escaped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the lions. Didst note his princely aspect when he confronted the
tyrant in the Forum? It were worse than tyranny to immolate
such a Roman.”</p>

<p>An aged man stood listening to the discourse. “The fangs of
the ferocious beasts,” he said, “were mercy to the inhuman cruelty
of Nero. The gods have at length awarded his doom, but the
marks of his malice and fury are deeply printed upon our city.”</p>

<p>“Most deeply in thy heart, old Crispus, thou hast good cause
to curse the memory of Nero.”</p>

<p>“Have I not! Curio,” said the old man, his gleaming eyes and
trembling limbs bespeaking his emotion, “where is my brave, my
noble boy, the support of my years, the idol of my love? Was
not his life sacrificed, daring to brave the vengeance of that
human monster, to wrest the wife of his love from even a more
dreadful fate than his own, from a more bloody beast than the
one that tore his mangled limbs?” Grief soon choked every other
emotion, and large tears rolled down his withered cheeks.</p>

<p>“Nay, good Crispus, nay; time has softened thy sorrow; do
not renew it.” “Rome will be at peace, now,” said Rutilius, “so,
mother,” continued he, addressing the aged woman, who had
appeared sunk in stupor, “thou mayst add another to thy list of
changes.” Her vacant gaze would have betokened inattention to
his address, but, as he spoke, she arose, though with difficulty,
and her voice, though clear and distinct, was faint. “Ye are the
creatures of change,” said she; “the idol of one hour, ye contemn
the next. There is One,” and her tone changed to a deep solemnity,
“who is said to be the same yesterday, today, and forever!
Believest thou in the God of the Christians?”</p>

<p>“Not I, mother, and methinks if thou dost, it is well for thine
aged limbs that Nero is not Emperor of Rome.”</p>

<p>“The years of my life are closing,” she said; “the thick darkness
which brooded over them is dispersing, the strength of this
weary body is failing, but light dawns upon the benighted soul.
Listen,” said she, her voice becoming more firm, “ere the number
of the days of my life have again passed, thine haughty Emperors
will acknowledge this God; these gilded temples will echo
with His worship, and the altars of thy false gods be overthrown
in the dust from whence they sprang.”</p>

<p>As they listened to her predictions with fixed attention she sank
again upon the step from which she had arisen. In a low and
soft cadence she continued: “The sweet music of my childhood’s
home sounds in mine ears, the fragrance of its fields steals over
my senses, and my pulse vibrates to the joyous measure of the
dancing virgins.” Her face became more deathly pale, her utterance
more broken. “Go,” said she, “to the noble Roman, Quintius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
Curtius, say to him that Sagana, the Thessalian, with her dying
breath implores a resting place beneath the cypress which shades
the grave of her mother; go; and thou, too, in thy last need, shalt
find a friend.”</p>

<p>Her head drooped upon a projection of rock, her eyes closed,
but as her spirit departed the rigid lines of her face relaxed and
a calm, serene expression stole over it, unknown to her life.</p>

<p>“’Tis the old witch of the mountain,” said Curio, “as very a
Hecate as ever took the form of an old woman.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not do her bidding,” said Rutilius.</p>

<p>“That will I,” said Crispus; “if these aged limbs will support
me, if the God of the Christians be her God, I will go on her
errand for the sake of my departed Cleia, the darling of my murdered
boy; she owned no other deity.” So saying, the good old
man adjusted the mantle over her marble features and, with slow
steps, pursued his way to the Appian palace.</p>

<p>“These Christians will be growing bold, now,” said Rutilius.</p>

<p>“Aye, that will they,” said Curio; “but it behooves them to be
cautious, for Galba, albeit not a Nero, is no friend to their rigid
doctrine.” The two citizens departed and the remains of the
being whose protracted years had now reached their end, whose
life of misery had closed in peace, were left alone. From the
time when wandering in solitary wretchedness, she had been led
by a Hand which she knew not near the secluded abode of the
pious Helena, had encountered the kind and lovely recluse, listened
to her soothing consolations, and had suffered her thoughts
to rise from the polluted depths of sin and despair, to the pure
and holy Heaven of hope, her perturbed spirit had been gradually
settling into peaceful rest. From this dark world her desires
ascended to one of light and joy and, though born and reared
amidst the gloom of Paganism, the bright beams of Christianity
had pierced the shadowy cloud. Alone, in a cold and friendless
world, she had lived, beset with trials and temptations; she had
now gone to an everlasting Friend, to One whose all-seeing eye
had watched her steps; whose Almighty arm had sustained her,
and who, in her last hours, had poured consolation into her
bruised and sorrowing heart.</p>

<p>The wild tumult of the mighty multitude reached not the peaceful
home of the revered Christian. As the sun arose in his morning
splendor, the majestic old trees, which surrounded the dwelling,
cast their gently waving shadows over the portico, where, in
sweet communion, sat the young Curtius and his sister. The
breezy fragrance of the early day was wafted as mild incense to
their senses, the clear soft music of the birds filled the air as an
offering to the Giver of all good, while afar, in the distant valleys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
borne upon the murmuring gale, was heard the mingled
sounds of rural life; the shepherd’s call, the answering flock, and
lowing cattle, contrasted happily with the harsher sounds from the
extended streets of the city. At intervals, from within the ancient,
but still stately dwelling, the solemn hymn, in honor of the noble
dead, would swell in full chorus, and the rich melody would almost
lead the soul of the listener to the heaven to which it directed
its thoughts. During its pauses, some old minstrel, who had followed
the fortunes of the family, through weal and through woe,
in shrill, but animated recitative, would rehearse its greatness, its
long line of renowned ancestors, their brave exploits and princely
endowments, and, as he ended by striking some high and lofty
notes upon his harp, the pealing sounds would arouse in the breasts
of the faithful retainers of the illustrious departed a portion of the
enthusiastic animation with which they had followed their lords to
the field of battle. The pride of birth, though subdued and regulated
by the power of religion, glowed in the hearts of the young
listeners, in whose persons were united the almost regal houses
from whom they counted their descent.</p>

<p>“This spot, my sister,” said Curtius, “is all that is left us of the
worldly wealth of our ancestors, but the legacy they have bequeathed
of incorruptible virtue, of integrity not to be bribed by
the allurements of pleasure, or the rewards of ambition, their patriotism,
and undaunted bravery, joined to the still richer one of
our pious father, makes us heirs of an inheritance not to be
weighed with the riches of this world. And mark, sweet sister,”
he continued, “the ruling hand of God. Yesternight, the setting
sun saw the tyrant Emperor surrounded with the riches of a tributary
world; from the banks of the Tiber to the farthest shores of
Britain, he ruled with despotic sway; yet his power and splendor
have vanished as a tale that is told; while the prisoner, whose
anticipations of the light of this day, but for mighty support, must
have been of agony and terror, is restored to the blessings of life
and liberty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my brother,” said Cleone, “we have awakened from a
dream of misery, and a life of grateful praise shall be devoted to
our God.”</p>

<p>“Mark yet again, my Cleone,” said the young Roman, “a few
short years since, amidst the courtly halls of Nero, moved a female,
whose transcendent beauty, and surpassing loveliness gave
her an irresistible influence over the heart of the capricious Emperor,
and her sway was undisputed, for it was gentle and unassuming,
and, even malice found no room for censure. Ere the
love of change, caprice, or estranged affection had doomed her to
disgrace, or perhaps, a worse fate, guided by a mysterious Providence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
her heart was subdued by the power of truth. She became
a Christian, and disdained to be longer a slave to the imperious
will of the tyrant. The marble floors no longer echoed her
light footstep, the places that had known her, knew her no more,
and the bright, the admired and queenly Valeria was lost to the
infamous courts of Nero. But, in the lowly homes of the poor,
by the couch of the sick and dying, the abode of the sorrowful
and despairing, a sweet and ministering spirit, teaches content
to the humble, soothes the distress, and points with a blissful hope
to a happy home in heaven.”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking their mother approached, followed by
an attendant, wearing the badge of the Flavian family.</p>

<p>“A messenger from your friend, my son.” “Health and long
life, from my lord Flavius,” said he. “He commends him to the
noble Curtius, and his honored family, the duties of his post,
near the Emperor, prevents his personal presence at this time,
but he craves permission to join them in celebrating the obsequies
of their noble kinsman.”</p>

<p>“Return our most hearty thanks,” said Curtius, “we will await
his presence.” “On my way hither,” said the messenger, “I encountered
the aged Crispus, who sought thy presence, noble Curtius,
hearing the last request of Sagana, the Thessalian Sybil, who
is even now dead, that she might lay by the side of her parent, in
her last resting place. The weary old man had gained the foot of
the hills, and rested awhile, ere he commenced the ascent. There
I overtook him, and offered to relieve him of his task. He has
now returned to watch the body, which lies under the Arch, near
the Preatorium, until thy further orders.”</p>

<p>“She has then gone to her rest,” said the matron. “The thread
upon which hung her protracted life has been severed by the exciting
scenes of the past night. May the peace which has so
lately dawned upon her soul rest and abide there! Let her last
wish, my Curtius, be fulfilled, and, glory to the God of mercy,
who has not suffered her sun to set in the dark cloud of Pagan
superstition.”</p>

<p>Soft music from within stole upon the air, and sweet voices
sang:</p>

<p>The reign of the depraved and barbarous persecutor of the
Christians had closed with the succession of Servius Galba, a
new era had dawned upon their fortunes; and, although the
“blood of the Martyrs” had proved “as seed to the Church,” yet
the season of peace and quiet, which now ensued served to foster
and ripen the Christian graces, which, in those days of cruelty and
inhuman bigotry acquired a stern and almost gloomy character.
The mild and beautiful religion of our Saviour, when allowed its
free course, in the sweet scenes of domestic life, shone with a
more benignant lustre, and its votaries, no longer shuddering with
the terror incident to human nature, at the consequences of avowing
their faith, fearlessly taught and practised its heaven-born
precepts.</p>

<p>The virtues of the noble family whose fortunes we have been
following, were expanded beneath the rays of the sun of prosperity,
and, for ages, some of the most undaunted defenders of
the Christian faith were ranked among its descendants. Connected
with illustrious and powerful houses, they were no longer
exposed to persecution themselves, and, were enabled, by their
influence, not only to promote the rapidly progressing cause of
Christianity, but to save many of its disciples from suffering in
the days of trial, which ensued in some of the subsequent reigns.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We have now closed our tale of the early Christians,” said
Herbert, “and, tho’ it is a simple story, and pretends to no romance
or mystery, yet it is not destitute of a moral.” “Very far
from it,” said Mrs. Wilson, “who can read the short, but well
authenticated account of the death of Nero, and contrast it with
that of the aged Christian, or even with the last moments of the
erring but misguided Sybil, without saying, ‘Let my death be
that of the righteous.’”</p>

<p>“Well, my little brother,” said Herbert, addressing Charles,
“you have very kindly abstained from criticisms during the course
of our reading. Now tell us if you have discovered any discrepancies,
through the narrative, as you are now, no doubt, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
your acquaintance with Roman history, able to discover.” “You
are laughing at me, Herbert, but I will tell you one error. It
was not Nero, I believe, who compelled the Senate to sanction
the election of his horse to the consulship, but Heliogabas.” “I
think you are right,” said Herbert. “He was, however, a kindred
spirit; and now, we will compare notes upon our improvement this
winter; beginning with you, Charles, of whose progress I can, in
some measure report, being your instructor.” “And, besides my
regular lessons,” said Charles, “I have read more than half
through Rollins Ancient History aloud to Susan.” “And,” said
Susan, “besides listening to Charles, while I sewed, I have reviewed
the History of England, and read Cowper’s Task, not to
mention reading the newspaper, etc., etc., and all this in addition
to my Latin lesson with Herbert.” “Please do explain those et
ceteras, my pretty cousin.” “Not I,” she replied, “I cannot burden
my memory with any more of my multifarious occupations.”
“You have forgotten that we have read the Pilgrim’s Progress
again.” “Ah! true,” said Susan, “and the life of the good old
dreamer; now, for as good an account of your winter studies,
my dear sister and cousin; but I am inclined to believe you will be
deficient unless you dignify with the name of study the art of
making bread, puddings, and pies, etc.” “One of the most useful
studies, Susan,” said Herbert, “only not leave the rest undone.”
“Do not imagine we have become mere household automatons,”
said Elizabeth. “In addition to a tolerable stock of the knowledge
to which Susan refers, we have read Gibbon’s Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire and Hunter’s Sacred Biography, besides
reaping some benefit from Charles’ reading.” “And I have
initiated Elizabeth into my little stock of French,” said Mary, “but,
Herbert, we shall not allow you to be sole catechist; we shall require
an account of the manner in which you have spent your
solitary hours, which, I am sure, have not been few.” “Must I
make full confession,” said he. “Full and free, without prevarication
or equivocation.” “Seriously, then, dear Mary, it
requires no little labor to retain my position in my
class, the other members of which are now pacing the
halls of old Harvard, in addition to those pleasant employments
enjoyed in common with the rest of you.” “Setting apart a little
time,” said Susan, laughing merrily, “devoted to the Muses. Ah!
Herbert, I have made the discovery, partly by my own sagacity,
and partly by the tell-tale expression of Aunt Wilson’s countenance,
that you are the author of much of the poetry which has
entertained us this winter.” “’Twas but the amusement of a
passing hour, dear Susan, and if it has been a source of interest
to you, an important end is attained.” “And you must continue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
that interest, my son,” said Mrs. Wilson, “if it will not interfere
with other duties. I think,” added she, addressing Mary and
Susan, “that your parents will approve your winter employment,
and that in after time you will review them without regret.”
“That I am sure we shall,” said Mary.</p>

<p>Some days had passed after the conversation which closed the
last chapter. A cold stormy evening found our little family without
visitors and prepared, as they drew around the table, which
displayed a goodly collection of needlework, etc., to listen to Herbert
as he read from a manuscript provided by Mrs. Wilson for
the entertainment of the evening.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Years have passed away and the events of the War of the
American Revolution are mingling with the obscurity of the past,
the glorious achievement of our liberty has opened a new era in
our history, “old things are done away,” but the imagination delights
to linger around the scenes of what seems now “olden
times”; scenes of peril and distress, but, over whose remembrance
a deep interest, a magical charm, is thrown by the knowledge that
our kindred and friends bore important parts in the drama, and
that the closing act was the freedom of our country. Many were
the events of deep and thrilling interest which are now buried in
oblivion, or known only to those immediately concerned. The
reminiscences which are the subject of these remarks may be
wanting in that intense interest, but as being a delineation of
the times, of their manners and feelings, and true, in all their
main incidents, they may claim some share of attention. It was
towards the latter part of May, 1775, but a short time before the
memorable battle of Bunker Hill, that a horseman, wearied and
worn with travel, exposed to the rays of the burning sun, on a
day of uncommon heat for the season, and whose horse seemed
sinking with fatigue, turned into a shady lane, leading from the
more public road to a small cluster of buildings, in the comparatively
thinly settled town of Malden, about four miles from Boston.
As he entered the pleasant shade, formed by the apple trees
which skirted the road, he permitted the tired animal to slacken its
pace, first casting an anxious and inquiring glance about him.
Apparently seeing no immediate cause for fear, he continued to
ride slowly; removed his hat, and wiping his warm and dusty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
brow, appeared to breathe more freely. His dress was that of a
gentleman, and his countenance, though pale and disturbed, was
intelligent and open. After pursuing this pace for about half a
mile, the cool and pleasant sound of running water directed his
attention to a watering place, at the side of the road, and the renewed
spirit of the steed, and his evident wish to taste the luxury,
induced his master to dismount, and lead him to the fountain. At
this moment a small dog springing up, and barking vehemently,
he perceived a woman seated upon a bank near. He started, for
his looks and manner had indicated that he sought concealment,
and, aiming a blow at the waspish little animal, was preparing to
remount his horse. “Come back, Faith,” said the woman, sharply,
then, as the dog slunk back to her feet, she continued, in an
apologetic tone: “He can’t do much harm, sir; he has seen his
best days; only he might frighten the beast, though, to be sure, he
looks too tired to mind a trifle.” “Do you live in this neighborhood?”
said the traveler, permitting his horse to graze the
green herbage around the watering place. “Just over the edge
of yonder hill,” said she, “but it’s something of a walk, and I’ve
nobody now to do my errands since John has gone.” “Do you
know Capt. B.’s family? Is he at home?” “Know the family!
That’s what I do; at home? No; bless your heart, no; at home!
indeed, you’ll find no able-bodied men at home now, more especially
the Captain. Where is he? Did you say? That’s what I
don’t know. Sent on some service or other; left every thing, sir,
family, land, cattle, and all at loose ends, for the sake of his
country; for the matter of that, old Sam Lynde, who has lost one
leg, and is nearly seventy, is the only man left behind; and he
would be glad to go; I can tell you. The country is all in arms,
sir, it’s as much as ever the reg’lars over in Boston can get any
food to eat, or wood to burn.” Without waiting to hear more the
questioner turned his horse. “Well,” said she, in a low soliloquy,
as he rode away, “I shouldn’t wonder if he was a Tory, for his
face didn’t brighten a bit when I told him how alive and stirring
our people were; I’ll warrant Faithful mistrusted him, or he
wouldn’t have been so spiteful.” So saying she rose, and passing
through a stile, into a path which led through a meadow, bent
her course in the direction she had indicated as her home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rider had pursued his way; as he passed he
regarded the objects around him with much interest and, when
he arrived at a spring of water at the side of the road, about a
mile from the last stopping place, he rested his horse upon the
little stone bridge which crossed the stream proceeding from the
spring. Gazing earnestly upon the pleasant spot, overshadowed
by tall trees, a train of sad, not unpleasant, reflections passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
through his mind. Who, that after long years of absence, has
revisited the spot where his infancy and childhood had passed in
the bosom of affection, but can sympathize with such reflections?
The well remembered perfume of the mint and sweet herbs which
grew around the never-failing spring in rich profusion revived
in his memory the playful hours of youth; he could, in imagination,
see the never-to-be-forgotten form of his mother, as she
came down the avenue which led to the house, to watch the sports
of her children, could retrace the pleasant smile and beaming
glance of her eye as she witnessed their little feats of skill and
strength, and hear her kindly voice warn them of danger; and
a mild but grave face of his father, as he would sometimes join
them, and, leaning over the balustrade of the little bridge, would
address to them some remark of affectionate interest, was present
to his mind, as if but a day had intervened. Where were
now those kind guardians, where the happy group which had
then mingled in sweet communion? The grave had closed over
the first, and time, absence and civil dissension had separated the
last. As these thoughts saddened his heart, tears filled his eyes,
but the heavy roll of cannon from some ship in the harbor aroused
him from his reverie and, turning from the spot which had
awakened these memories, he passed up the avenue we have referred
to, to the mansion of his birth, and now the residence of
the family of his brother. All was quiet around, except, at intervals,
the merry laugh or gleeful shout of childish mirth echoed
from the green lawn, where he saw three little beings pursuing
their happy sport. “The children of my brother,” he thought,
but they were too far for him to distinguish them particularly.
Alighting and approaching the door, he saw an elderly female
seated and engaged in knitting. As he drew near she looked up,
and, after scanning his countenance attentively a few moments,
she rose hastily, dropped her work, and ejaculated: “Mercy upon
me, Mr. Nathaniel! Is it you?” “It is indeed myself, Prudy;
how has it happened that, after so many years, you have not forgotten
me?” “There is not one of your family I shall forget while
I have reason,” said she, “but the news reached us that you had
sailed for England and I never thought to see you again.” “I
am now on my way to Boston, to embark in the first vessel that
leaves the harbor for the home of my ancestors, but I am escaping
from enemies, my good Prudy, enemies to me and, as I believe,
to their lawful king. Will you afford refreshment to one whom
you no doubt believe to be a traitor to his country?” “You
should not talk so, Mr. Nathaniel; you are in your brother’s
house, though, may be, if he were here, he would look upon you
with a frowning brow; yet his wife will not, I am sure, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
will but let her know you are here before I take care of you and
your horse.” She then led the way into the house and, showing
him into an apartment, she left him alone. How well remembered
was the prospect from those windows! The pleasant green that
sloped from the house, the old pear trees at the foot of the declivity,
while, in the distance, but directly opposite, lay the town
of Boston, with its tall spires, and the harbor, with its masts.
There was the clump of walnut trees where he had gathered nuts
and, near by, the old apple tree which had obtained the name of
“mother’s tree,” because it bore an apple which was her favorite
fruit, and even as he gazed, the old bell of Brattle Street Church,
with its deep tone, struck its well remembered chime. There is
something in the breath of spring that especially revives the
memory of the past and it was with many a sweet and sad recollection
that the wanderer lingered near the window and turned
reluctantly at the opening of the door. The wife of his brother
greeted him with affectionate kindness and her sympathy and
soothing words cheered his heart. In answer to her wish that he
could stay with them, could enter into the feelings of his countrymen
and aid them in their exertions for freedom from unjust
exactions, he said: “It is in vain, dear Hester, to think of it;
though I may feel as you do, that our king has been misled by
evil counsellors; that he has imposed harsh restrictions upon these
colonies, and, by these means, alienated the affections of the people,
still, in my opinion, my allegiance is due to him and to him
it must be paid. Other influences have contributed to strengthen
my early attachment to the English government; since I last saw
you I have been betrothed to the daughter of a British officer,
most amiable and beloved, and have had my hopes and anticipations
blasted by her death. Her country must still be
mine; but I have been almost a martyr to my loyalty,
for I have been seized as a Tory, accused, though most
unjustly, of transmitting intelligence to the royal army, immured
in close confinement, and, though not harshly treated, yet
debarred from communication with my friends. The hours spent
in such solitude were dreary enough, uncheered by sympathy or
affection, though not abandoned by hope, for I still trusted in the
exertions of those who, I was confident, would use their utmost
endeavors for my release. I was not mistaken in my expectations,
for two days ago, as I paced my gloomy apartment in solitary
musing, the door was unlocked and a person entered who
had a few times officiated as my jailor. He performed some
trifling offices and, as he retired, left the door ajar, casting, as
I thought, a significant glance at me. I followed at some distance,
but, losing sight of him at the foot of the stairs, I passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
out at the door; and, seeing a horse, prepared for a journey,
fastened to the railing, I mounted without any hesitation, concluding,
I have no doubt rightly, that the means of escape were
thus provided by friends. I have scarcely allowed myself rest
or refreshment, being fearful of pursuit, and, by changing horses,
I have at last arrived so near the place of my destination, which
is Boston, from whence, as soon as possible, I shall embark for
England; for I can not join against my countrymen in this contest.
You will sympathize with me in this resolution, my dear
sister?” “Yes,” said she, “but you are exhausted and must
stay here until you are refreshed.” “No,” he said, “if I can elude
the Argus vigilance of your excited populace I shall be in Boston
tonight and, besides, I must not subject your good husband to
the mortification of knowing that his Tory brother has obtained
an asylum under his roof. I know too well his uncompromising
zeal in behalf of the colonies and his determined animosity to
those whom he considers their enemies.” Prudy now entered and
placed upon the table the refreshments she had prepared, with
many excuses for what she termed the homely fare; but the fine
fish, the fresh, though coarse, bread, and sweet butter needed no
apology and were duly appreciated by the way-worn traveler.
To renew what she called his exhausted spirits she had prepared
what was, at that time, a luxury, a cup of tea, and, as he inhaled
the perfume so grateful to the wearied frame, he smiled at the
good woman and said: “How is this, Prudy, are you not too much
of a patriot to use this prohibited beverage, and in the house, too,
of one of the most determined rebels against his king?” The
color mounted in the cheeks of the faithful domestic as she prepared
to make an energetic defence, but her mistress replied,
with a ready smile: “Nay, brother, you must not quarrel with your
physician, or the medicine, though it be contraband. Your
brother, being far away, is not responsible for the misdemeanors
of the two lonely inhabitants of his deserted home. And, truly,
this cheering herb is now only used as a medicine. We join heart
and hand, however, with our brave countrymen in deprecating
the tyrannical laws which have deprived us of many comforts,
besides, this more especially,” she said, and the tears glittered in
her eyes, “of the society of those nearest and dearest to our
hearts.” “God grant, dear Hester, that this most unnatural war
may soon cease, for, if continued, misery and extermination will
be the fate of these flourishing colonies.” “We hope for better
things, brother, the united exertions of so many true and noble
hearts as are scattered through the country, with the help of God,
in a just cause, will effect miracles.” Three beautiful little girls
now appeared at the door and, being told by their mother to approach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
received the caresses of their uncle. The eldest was a
bright and beautiful child of nine years, full of life and animation;
the second a mild, sedate and quiet little creature of five,
and the youngest a fair, rosy and plump little one of two, whose
every step was a bound and whose joyous laugh exhilarated the
listener. “You are happy, Hester, in this little group; they are
very lovely and health and light-hearted pleasure is expressed in
every motion.” The praise of these objects of her affection
brought a bright glow of satisfaction to her cheeks. “Ah,” said
she, “if their father was but with us; while danger and death
surround him we can not be happy.” The tears that again filled
her eyes at this recollection dimmed the flush of affection and
Prudy, who was most devotedly attached to her, said, with some
indignation: “Shame upon the tyrant who has cast such a shadow
over our happy homes! I must say what I think, Mr. Nathaniel,
if he is your king. What business had he to interfere with our
rights, and to impose taxes upon us to support his unjust wars
and wicked extravagance?” “He has had bad advisers, Prudy,
and the time will come when he will be advised of this.” “Too
late for his good,” said she. “Our people would not have known
their strength, perhaps, but when they once find it out they will
no longer live subjects to England.” “Perhaps you are right,”
said he, “and when these cruel difficulties are all settled, my good
friend, we will yet hope to meet and discuss these questions amicably.
I must now leave you, my kind sister, with my prayer that
the blessing of Heaven may rest upon you and your dear family;
and you, Prudy, you, who watched over my youth, and was ever
kind and affectionate to the wayward boy”—his voice faltered—“if
I never meet you again on earth, may we meet in Heaven!”
The good woman now sobbed aloud as he shook her hand, and no
less affectionate was the farewell upon the part of the mother
and her little family. “You will let us hear of your safety, dear
brother, before you leave the country?” “If I possibly can; I
am not, however, without serious fears of being apprehended
this side of Boston.” At this moment an energetic but cracked
voice was heard, singing the chorus to one of the patriotic songs
of the day:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So, one and all, my merry boys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Be up, and bravely doing;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll drive the British o’er the seas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And fairly prove their ruin.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There,” said Prudy, hastily wiping her eyes; “there’s old
Sam Lynde, going with the market cart, over to Charlestown;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
now, if we could but make him think you were sent by your
brother, he never would suspect you to be a Tory, and then you
might go safely.” She went out in haste and they soon heard
her voice at the door conferring with the old man: “People are
so suspicious now, you know, Sam,” said she, “that he might
be stopped and hindered, when it is of so much importance that
he should be there by sundown.” “I’ll see to it; I’ll see to it,”
said he, as he adjusted his basket, and mounted the vehicle with
difficulty. “Well, wait a minute,” said she, and, returning, she
told them, what they had already gathered, that it would be expedient
for him to proceed immediately under the auspices of the
old gardener. With a most affectionate but sad adieu they
parted, fearing what proved but too true, that they should never
meet again on earth. This was but one of the many parting scenes
of that eventful period; that season of civil war, for it truly deserved
that name, though three thousand miles of wide ocean lay
between the contending nations. Families were divided, father
against son and brother against brother; kindred ties were severed
and the heavy cloud of domestic dissension hung over this
once peaceful country. But, confident in a just cause, a band of
noble spirits joined in a holy league to resist oppression, to rise
above the crushing hand of tyrannical power, and force their way
to freedom. It was a glorious resolution and gloriously did it
triumph.</p>

<p>The soft breeze of evening, laden with the sweets of spring,
stole over the fading landscape, the light tinkle of some solitary
cow-bell and the shrill and monotonous notes of the frogs alone
breaking the stillness immediately around the anxious listeners
who were awaiting the return of the old market man, which, they
hoped, would relieve their suspense as to the safety of the fugitive.
But, notwithstanding the calm repose of this scene was
undisturbed, the busy sounds of life were heard in the distance,
for, though the road to Boston by the highway was four miles,
yet the distance across the marshes, which lay opposite the house,
was but little over a mile, and the roll of the drum, with other
martial sounds, was distinctly heard. Sad and depressing the
thought that weighed upon the mind of the mistress of the mansion;
her little ones were at rest and all was quiet around, but
how long would it remain so? Her husband was far away, the
time of his return uncertain, if, indeed, he would ever again return.
The enemy were becoming more and more incensed at the
insults and aggressions of the colonists, who, in their turn, were
burning with indignation at the tyranny of the regular troops,
as they were called, and each day produced some new cause of
hatred and defiance on both sides. Scarcely a ray of hope lighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
the deep gloom of the future and, though striving to resign herself
and her all into the hands of Almighty Love, her heart
throbbed with anxious fears. The good Prudy sat near, plying
her knitting needles, which, in those days of simplicity, before
the inventions of modern times rendered their use obsolete, or, at
least unfashionable, were indispensable accompaniments of the female;
and, with the earnest freedom and interest which her long
residence in the family warranted, endeavored to wile away
the melancholy which shaded the brow of her mistress. “It seems
but a few days,” said she, “since they were all children and I,
though not quite so young, as blithe and happy, for never had a
poor orphan ever found a happier home than I had. I was treated
as one of the family and as long as I live I shall cleave to it. The
sight of Mr. Nathaniel has brought old times to my mind and
I can not abide the thought that the son of his father is a Tory,
but he never had the firm judgment of his brother. Trust in the
Lord, my mistress, and all will be right, let what may happen. It
is a great lesson to learn but, once learned, it serves us all the
rest of our lives. I much wonder old Sam is so long coming;
he is not gone, usually, more than two hours.” “He is old and
infirm, Prudy, and we need not wonder if we do not see him
before morning; but we will watch some time longer.” And,
changing the conversation, they conferred upon their household
affairs and domestic matters in which the kind handmaid took
an affectionate interest. Another hour passed and, becoming convinced
that something had occurred to prevent the return of the
old man, they retired to rest.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Would it have been better, mother,” said Elizabeth, “if the
colonies had been contented to remain under the English government?
When I hear of these sad times of war, I am almost
tempted to wish they had continued in quiet subjection.” “The
exactions and encroachments of the parent country,” said Mrs.
Wilson, “were too flagrant; the colonists would have dishonored
their ancestors had they borne unmoved the tyranny of the English
ministry, but it was long before they could divest themselves
of the feeling of dependence upon England, the home of their
fathers, and break the tie which had bound them to their laws
and institutions. They submitted to many petty abuses and extortions,
they petitioned and remonstrated for the redress of more
palpable ones, and it was not until a series of gross insults and
unpardonable neglect of every appeal to the justice of the king
and his ministers had aroused the indignation of the people of
these States to a pitch that could not be controlled that they had
recourse to arms as a last resort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“And the result showed,” said Herbert, “that the God of justice
was upon their side, and fought their battles, for, surely, there
was never a more apparently hopeless cause than that of the united
colonies, against their powerful oppressor.”</p>

<p>“Here is a young hero,” said Susan, turning to Charles, “who
would have joined heart and hand with his countrymen. I wish
you had marked how he winced at your unpatriotic question,
Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding which question,” said Herbert, “I am very
sure if our gentle sister had lived in those days she would have
assisted energetically in melting the weights of the old clock for
bullets, or any other measure deemed necessary by the fair enthusiasts
of those trying times.”</p>

<p>“I am very sure, dear brother, however much I might deprecate
the war, and its train of evils, the comforts of those dear to me
would have been uppermost in my thoughts.” After cheerful
conversation, they separated for the night.</p>

<p>A mild and pleasant morning tempted the young party to a
walk, which was rendered more delightful by anecdotes related
by Herbert relative to the first settlement of the place, with
which he had become familiar from his intercourse with some of
the aged people of the town, and which caused many a laugh from
their quaint simplicity. He pointed out to them the site of the
first building erected for public worship, for the earliest object
with our pious ancestors was to provide a suitable place in which
to bow together before the God who had guided them over the
wide waters to this pleasant home; and the bell, which even at this
time summoned the inhabitants to their devotions, was the same
which was sent by kind friends from England for the service
and ornament of the original sanctuary. It was a spot, retired
from the village, upon the seashore, and, though the sacred building
had long since been removed, there was a quiet loneliness
about it, which seemed suited to the purpose to which it had been
dedicated. “When we return home,” said Herbert, “I will read
you some lines founded upon an anecdote connected with the old
church which formerly occupied this situation; the moss-grown
tombstone, covered with so many ancient inscriptions, which you
remember, Elizabeth, we have so often endeavored to decipher,
covers the remains of the good minister, who figures as one of the
characters, but I cannot hope to inspire you with the same interest
which I felt, when in my twelfth year, I first listened to the
story from the lips of a good old dame, who is no longer among
the living.” At the appointed time, after their return home, he
read the following lines; which they decided should be called</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Time was, when tyrant power in Britain’s Isle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ruled with despotic sway; when pious men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were hunted like wild beasts if they should dare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To worship God in their own way; the way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which they believed, in pure simplicity</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be acceptable to Him, whose eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All seeing and all knowing, looks alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the intent and purpose of the heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With firm resolve they left their native land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their home, their own green fields, and shady lawns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And o’er the pathless ocean took their course</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the wild shores of a far distant clime;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There, no proud king or haughty priest has power,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Now, happy homes and fertile fields arose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On those far shores, and pointing to the heavens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tall church spire reflected the bright sun;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sons of God had gathered here, but, as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was, in ancient time, when Satan came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amidst their councils, and, with wily art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laid schemes to tempt the holy man to sin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So now, among the pious race, crept in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some bad designing ones, whose cunning aim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was to seduce the good and pious heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or, failing this, to turn his holy zeal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ridicule; to watch for some weak spot;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, who, in this imperfect world of ours</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is free from imperfection; and, when found</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With jeering mockery, to cause him shame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a small village dwelt a good old man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beloved and honored for his kindly heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Zealous in prayer, in duty prompt and true;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With guileless life, and firm and holy faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The peaceful tenour of his life passed on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Sexton of the parish, his white hairs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were reverenced by the simple pious flock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whom his services were duly paid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save by some graceless ones, who long had made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The kind old man the butt of many a joke;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, as we often mark, the wicked jest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would harmlessly rebound from its rude aim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wound the miscreant who had sped the bolt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas on a windy, dark and stormy night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the old sexton rose from his warm hearth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To brave the old and dreary autumn rain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, on each night, at nine, the old church bell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was rung, with the intent that all should then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go to their quiet rest; that peaceful sleep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might be the portion of each weary frame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till morn should rouse them to their daily toil.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those were the days when superstition’s power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was felt by all; none from its gloomy chains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were free; the grave divine and the wise sage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alike confessed its sway, its potent rule;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, if dark fears of unknown ill had power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To shake the nerves of learned ministers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We need not wonder if our worthy friend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was not exempt from this besetting ill.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was a night, he thought, when wicked fiends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would triumph in the mischief they might cause;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, though his faith in the Almighty power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guard his steps, was all unshaken still,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet dismal fears and dark foreboding thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would rush, unbidden, thro’ his beating heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The kind old dame shared in his fears of ill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, as with care, she wrapped about his neck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The warm and woolly comforter, with words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of warning kind, she urged his quick return.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He sallied forth, and onward bent his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the lone church, which stood so near the shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the rude waves on such a night as this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would almost dash their spray upon its side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wild wind roared amongst the woods, and seemed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Contending with the loud and deafening surge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the pale rays, which from his lantern gleamed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But served to show the black and muddy pools</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That filled the road. Onward the good man strode,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the same courage, summoned to his aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would have been lauded in the warrior bold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slowly the ponderous key turned in the bolt;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through the broad aisle, he moved, with cautious tread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starting at the dull echo of his steps.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, as he raised the light to seize the rope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its beams shone full upon the sacred desk;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What fearful sight appalled his shuddering gaze!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Gorgon’s head usurped the holy place,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, to his terror-stricken mind appeared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The embodied form of Lucifer himself!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He stopped not to encounter the foul fiend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, rushing forth, stayed not his course, until</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Safe landed at the reverened pastor’s door.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great was the wonder, strong was the dismay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With which the pious man heard the dark tale;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, with the conscious rectitude of truth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He seized the Holy Book, with firm resolve</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the foul spirit should no longer hold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Usurped dominion o’er that hallowed spot.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Torrents of rain descending, seemed to warn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The zealous pair from the encounter rash,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still, strong in faithful confidence, they gained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fatal spot, when, with his talisman</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uplifted, uttering words of mighty power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pious pastor, with firm step and slow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Approached the dreaded form, though, strange to tell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wicked Tempter seemed to stand his ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nearer and nearer they advance, and then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ascend the stairs, armed for the conflict dire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, now, the shameless mockery unveiled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shows but the head and horns of an old sheep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moment’s pause, and, then a pleasant smile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illum’ed the good man’s face, as he addressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The indignant sexton in a kindly tone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“We have been weakly credulous, my friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our foolish fears have stolen our better sense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis the vile trick of some rude infidel;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, we will turn his bad intent to good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“And learn a lesson from this seeming ill.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Henceforth, we will not suffer coward fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“To thwart our judgment, or disturb our peace.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So saying, with strong arm, he drew away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The unseemly object; and, with ready hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bell was rung by the old servitor;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as they parted, each to his own home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With mild and gentle tone, the pastor said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do not forget, my good old friend, tonight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ere you lie down upon your peaceful bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“To offer to our God, the prayer of faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“That He would turn the erring mind from sin.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The morn arose, and the dark clouds dispersed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the fresh and health inspiring gale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the malicious jester made his way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Towards the old church, to mark what the effect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had been, of his vile mockery; whether</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His trick had been discovered, or, unseen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the old man, the foul caricature</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still occupied the holy preacher’s desk.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The beast he rode was vicious as himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, as he turned the angle of the wall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the highroad, upon the level green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scared by some object, which beset his path,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fiery steed reared high, then plunging down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Threw his unwary master to the ground.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas the grim object, which, with cunning skill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He had prepared for the good Sexton’s harm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, which, on that dark night, the pious pair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had drawn away, and thrown beside the wall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With many a deep and heavy groan, he lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till guided by the same wise Providence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The kind old man ’gainst whom the plot was laid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Came to his rescue, and, with kindly care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soothed his distress, and brought him timely aid.</div>

inducement to attempt it, my dear cousin, if it will interest

<p>On the succeeding evening Herbert proceeded to read to the
assembled listeners the continuation of the reminiscences of the
times of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>While the heart of many a patriotic American was throbbing
with indignation and anxiety, and the countenances of many a
mother, wife, daughter or sister was pale with watching and
tears, the face of nature was delightful and undisturbed. The
soft breezes were rich with the perfume of flowers and shrubs, the
verdant fields glittered with the dew, the sweet melody of birds
and hum of insects enlivened the scene, while the cattle, with
measured steps, were pacing the accustomed path, toward their
green pasture. With the early dawn the old marketman had
returned, and brought stirring news. The roads, he said, were
filled with soldiers, and tents were pitched in every convenient
place; they would permit no provisions to be carried into Boston,
and had even succeeded in carrying off the cattle which were pastured
on the islands in the harbor, so that it was supposed that
the British troops were likely to have much difficulty in procuring
food. “Our troops are ready and brave enough,” said he, “if they
be not trained for service, and, what if their muskets be of all
sizes and shapes, the main thing is to know how to use them,
which, I’ll warrant they do.” They had proceeded without any
interruption, he said, until they had crossed Malden Bridge, when
they were stopped by a small party of soldiers, who, after some
questions, permitted him to go on, but refused to let the gentleman
pass until they received further orders from their commander;
that he had waited until they applied to him, who “luckily,”
said the old man, “proved to be General Knox, and you may
be sure that he would see that any friend of Captain B.’s had
his rights, so, after some talk apart, he not only allowed him to
proceed, but sent a man with him, that he might not be again
stopped, and I saw him depart, after he had shaken hands with
me, and left this piece of money with me, like a gentleman as he
is.” He proceeded to say, that as it was late before he concluded
his business, he had stopped at the house of an old acquaintance,
near the Bridge. Thus relieved of their anxiety, they could now
listen with interest, to the details of old Sam. “The regulars will
be starved out, by and by,” said he, “if they don’t get scared to
death first. They say that three of their generals, as they were
walking down Beacon Hill, the other night, heard strange noises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
over their heads, which they supposed to be some kind of airguns,
fired at them by the Yankee rebels, as they called them, and took
to their heels with such expedition that they nearly fell headlong;
but, after all,” said he, with an explosion of great glee, “it was
only the humming of beetles, and if they run for such imaginations,
what will they do when they stand, face to face, with our
brave boys? And, there is a plan afoot, which will soon settle the
business; it is to erect works on the hill in Charlestown, which
overlooks Boston, so that our men can fire in among them.” He
then proceeded to say that the British would not permit the inhabitants
of Boston to leave the town, or hold any communication
with their friends; that it was said reinforcements from England
were daily expected, and that the Americans were anxious to
strike some bold stroke, before their arrival. More than all, he reported,
that George Washington, of Virginia, was appointed Commander
in Chief of the American Armies, “and a noble commander
it is said he will make, being an old soldier, and, that it
will not be long before he will be before Boston.” The heart of
the affectionate mother throbbed with anxiety at these tidings.
Situated as they were, in the very seat of contention, what would
be the result if the enemy were victorious, and succeeded in dispersing
her countrymen, and what would become of her, and her
helpless little family? Anticipating such an emergency, her husband,
in his last letter, had directed her to leave their home, and,
with her little girls, retire to her native place, which was about
forty miles in the interior, there to await his return, or the indications
of Providence. With a heavy heart, after taking the
advice of the good Prudy, who, with disinterested affection, offered
to stay at the mansion as long as it was safe, she determined
that the crisis which her husband had foreseen, had now arrived,
and that she would follow his directions. “If,” said her faithful
domestic, “it comes to the worst, Sam and I can shut up the house,
turn out the cattle, and retire over the hill to his sister’s, where we
shall be safe, but, it would not do for you, with these little ones,
to run such a risk. You can now go with safety in the old chaise;
which is roomy enough to hold considerable, and, you will not be
afraid to drive the horse, who, tho’ not swift, is sure.”</p>

<p>Having come to this resolution, no time was to be lost, and they
immediately commenced preparations for the journey.</p>

<p>The morning arrived when she must bid farewell to the scene
of so much peace and quiet domestic joy, perhaps never again to
see it, for she could not conceal from herself that fire and sword
were the accompaniments of modern warfare; but her children,
delighted at the journey, would not suffer a shade to linger upon
her brow, and Prudy, amidst smiles and tears, uttered her affectionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
adieu, echoed by Sam. The day was beautiful, and the
wild enthusiasm of her companions prevented her indulgence in
melancholy reflections, while the road led them away from the
scenes of tumult and confusion, and she trusted they might escape
observation. She was not disappointed; night brought them to
the home of her youth, where a joyous welcome awaited them,
and until better times, a peaceful retreat.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Mrs. Wilson, “I must leave my farther tale
untold. Perhaps at some future time I may continue it, and I
think it will interest you, as the incidents are connected with your
family.” “I had hoped, mother,” said Charles, that you would tell
us about Bunker Hill.” “I should not be a good historian, my
son, in tales of war and bloodshed. Charlestown was burned by
the British, as you know, but their devastations stopped there, at
that time, and our old mansion was left unharmed and safe, till
such time as its owners could return to its peaceful shades.”
“And did the Tory uncle never return to America?” “He did
not; he reached England in safety, but did not live long after
that event. I will relate one little circumstance, Charles, which
happened at this time. There was a poor widow, who occupied a
small house in Charlestown, which was destroyed during the conflagration,
and which comprised the whole of her fortune. She
had contrived to support herself and two children by her daily
exertions, but was now left destitute indeed. With the hope of
assistance from some friends, in an adjoining town, she took her
departure from the scene of destruction, carrying one child in
her arms, while the other, an active little boy of four years, closely
followed her footsteps. As he trudged along and employed the
little staff with which his mother had provided him, in tracing
lines in the road, he struck something which, by its brightness, attracted
his attention. Picking it up and delighted with his prize,
he soon overtook his mother and showed her a ring, the value of
which was evident by its costly diamond, and the initials and
cypher upon the inside. The good woman, rather perplexed than
pleased with this circumstance, and tired with her walk, sat down
with her children upon some timber to deliberate upon what she
should do with her acquisition. Two gentlemen, whose dress announced
them to be British officers, were walking slowly by, and
as they passed, she heard one say, ‘It must have been near this
spot. It was a last memento, and the loss is to me irreparable.”
Thinking it possible this observation might refer to the ring, she
immediately addressed them, and related the circumstance of her
son’s finding it. It was directly identified, and claimed by the officer,
who had made the remark which had attracted her attention.
He had discovered his loss, and was then retracing his steps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
though almost hopeless of recovering his treasure. He was a
nobleman of high rank in the army, and, after a few words of inquiry,
she received not only present assistance, but assurance that
her son should never want a friend. The promise was faithfully
fulfilled, and through the assistance of their kind benefactor, he
received an education, which has enabled him to take a high stand
in his profession, which was that of a clergyman, and he is now
a much respected minister in this vicinity.”</p>

<p>Many days of open weather now intervened, when winter
appeared to meditate resigning his sovereignty. The snow disappeared
from the hills which surrounded their pleasant retreat,
little sunny nooks were visible where the early violet might shelter,
and the sands on the seashore were becoming bright and
sparkling. Delightful as were these indications of spring, the
inmates of Mrs. Wilson’s abode were not inclined to wish for its
rapid approach. The winter had not only been pleasantly, but
they all felt, profitably, spent, that seed had been sown which
might, by careful culture, produce an abundant harvest. The
joyous and lively spirits of Susan still retained all their buoyancy
and she joined them on the sands where they were watching the
white sails of the vessels as they were leaving the harbor, as the
sun shone full upon them.</p>

<p>“They are leaving their homes,” said Elizabeth, “to cross that
ocean, which, though now so serene, we have seen under such
different aspects.” “And,” said Herbert, “they are, no doubt,
elated with the pleasant auspices under which they commence
their voyage. Sailors are a superstitious race; they dread to
leave their port under a lowering sky; and it is almost impossible
to induce them to embark on Friday. You will frequently see
them on a land-cruise, as they call it, to overhaul the log-book of
the redoubtable Moll Pitcher, or some old fortune teller, relative
to the success of their voyage, the constancy of their sweethearts,
etc., and the wise old lady prognosticates so much to their satisfaction
that they return in great glee, after leaving with her a
goodly portion of their well-filled purses.” “It is surely a kind
Providence,” said Mary, “which hides from us the events of futurity.
How wretched would be every intervening moment were
we certain of the time of some great calamity!”</p>

<p>“True, Mary,” said Herbert, “and there are many who, without
this knowledge, suffer a thousand deaths in fearing one. I
refer to those who are ever anticipating evil, who prophesy destroying
frost in every cold wind and blight or blasting mildew
in the warm sun or refreshing rain.” “I am decidedly of the
opinion,” said Susan, “that such persons are worse in society than
drones in a hive, for the idle person generally injures himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
more than any one else, but the discontented one makes others
wretched by imparting to them a portion of his bitterness. It
gives me the fidgets to hear poor Mrs. Flagg complain of this
wicked world, protesting that everybody is governed by selfish
motives and, shaking her head, declare that there is no such thing
as happiness on earth, and yet she enjoys, or seems to enjoy, to
perfection a good cup of tea and a warm cake.”</p>

<p>“We are too young, as yet, my cousin,” said Herbert, “and have
seen too few of the trials of life to controvert, positively, the good
woman’s assertion, but, when we look around us and see so much
beauty, so much to love and admire, we may be sure that our
Creator did not place us here to be miserable.”</p>

<p>“Now for a race, Charles,” said Susan; “I shall be at the gate
first.”</p>

<p>They met Mrs. Wilson at the door and she greeted them with
joyful news; a letter had arrived from their parents. The health
of their father had so much improved that he wrote of speedy
return and rejoiced in the happiness so apparent in the letters of
his children. There was but one shadow to this pleasant news,
the breaking up of their winter enjoyments, but Herbert reminded
them that at any rate his vacation was nearly at an end;
that they could look back upon this Winter in Retirement with
almost unalloyed pleasure and forward with the cheering hope of
future joyous meetings; also with the certainty that, by the help
of Providence, the treasures stored in their minds through this,
at first, dreaded season, would prove precious and available in all
the varying events of their lives. “We will improve the time yet
left us and I will read you this evening some lines written by a
lady born in this town.”</p>

<p>“Though the local scenery of Lynn,” said Mrs. Wilson, “is not
essentially changed since this was written, many of its manners
and customs are. The good old Puritan days have somewhat
gone by; but it is pleasant to read something which refers to the
time when they were reverenced and appreciated.”</p>

Peaceful and calm as Sabbath’s holy eve.</h2>
</div>

<p>On the ensuing Sabbath evening the conversation turned upon
the public services of the day, which were rendered interesting to
Charles, as well as the others, by their reference to the ancient
history of Palestine. “There is now left,” said Herbert, “but the
dust and ruins of these celebrated countries of antiquity. Were
it not for these, even yet, splendid mementoes of the former greatness
of ancient Syria, we should be lost in wonder and credulity
when we contrast the history of its past grandeur with the accounts
of modern travelers. How puny do the works of our
days of boasted superiority appear, compared with the colossal
ruins of Balbec and Palmyra, where the stones of which their
mighty edifices were composed would seem to require the
strength of giants, or such machinery as the mechanism of these
times can hardly imagine, to place them in their appointed situation.
The plains of Syria, from the earliest records of time,
have been the theatre on which the most interesting scenes have
been performed. Embattled legions have here fought to the
death, and the footsteps of the messengers of peace on earth,
preceded by those of their Divine Master, have pressed the favored
soil. Here, too, the wild fanaticism of the Crusades rose to
its climax, here the brave, but imprudent and improvident Richard
of England, and the generous, noble-hearted Saladin figured in
their brief careers. These scenes possess an indescribable charm
for the Christian, while they present inexhaustible themes for poetry
and romance.” “Your enthusiasm, dear Herbert,” said Elizabeth,
“would lead us to suppose that you, too, had taken them
for a theme; do not deny us the pleasure of profiting by the inspiration.”
“I will not,” said he, “though I have only attempted
a paraphrase of an incident related in the Scriptures.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">To the enraptured wanderer’s gaze</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sweet retreat, whose verdure bright</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath an Olive’s spreading shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The holy prophet knelt and prayed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The leper, with his pompous train,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assistance asks, nor asks in vain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Go wash in Jordan’s sacred stream,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The prophet said, “Wash and be clean.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With proud disdain, the Syrian turned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such simple means his nature spurned;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some mighty deed, he proudly thought.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was needful, when his cure was wrought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Are not our Syrian streams,” he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Better than Jordan’s vaunted tide?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Is not Arbana’s silver wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Or Pharphar’s flood, fit place to lave?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, yielding to affection’s prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The haughty leper sought the shore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Jordan’s swelling waters flowed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bathed him in the healing flood;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, rising from the holy stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No loathsome leprosy is seen;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No tainted blood his system knows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, pure the healthful current flows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No sickly scales his flesh deform,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the fair child’s, now soft and warm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With joyful heart, and thankful praise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To Israel’s God, he lifts his eyes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is no God, but Israel’s God;”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wondering train repeat the word.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas eve; on Syria’s sandy plains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The scorching sun no longer beams;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Athwart the weary traveler’s brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The chilling night-wind passes now;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The prowling thief, with murderous steel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each sandy hillock may conceal;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where shall the wanderer find repose?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How shall he ’scape his secret foes?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On; pilgrim, on; yon glimmering light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, through the distance, greets thy sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is the bright beacon-ray to guide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy toiling footsteps to its side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not now does sorrow’s gloomy cloud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That lovely spot in darkness shroud;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No rites, unholy, now are there;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No tainted incense fills the air;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On; pilgrim, on; for Israel’s God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is worshiped there, by Syria’s lord;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the rich mercies he receives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With bounteous hand he freely gives.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And now that our “Winter in Retirement” has drawn to a
close, let us hope that the lesson we have tried to inculcate, that
a life of excitement, and scenes of continued gayety are not necessary
for the happiness of the young, may not be unheeded by
those for whose benefit it is written. Life is too precious, too
priceless a gift from our Father in heaven for part of its hours
to be spent in trifling amusements, part in resting after their
fatigue, and part in sad reflections upon their inutility. May this
little volume, through His blessing, carry an antidote for these
evils, and lead our youth to try its efficacy.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Autumn drew near; and, with her magic brush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had touched the landscape; on the mountain’s slope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bright tints were mingling with the evergreens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crowning its heights; and, as the freshening breeze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swept onward, in its joyous course it bore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The many colored leaves, the forest’s pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some few were green, and to the thoughtful mind</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Recalled the youthful spring, in verdure rich;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Others appeared, touched with bright summer’s ray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mingled with the glowing heaps, bring back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sunny days of bright July; but more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Displayed deep crimson hues, or, orange, gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or golden yellow; or, perchance, laid clothed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In sombre garb—</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">I sought, long time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A title for my Book; Leaves there are here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Thought and Memory; some fresh like youth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many tinged with Autumn’s varying shades;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While, over all, a brightening light is cast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The light of Hope.</div>
